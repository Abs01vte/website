<h1>The Conceit of Suffering</h1>

"Pain is just weakness leaving the body,"
Or so I've heard
"If strength is born from heartbreak,
Then mountains I could move"
Or so I believe
Weakness to others is just that
To me, it's strength

Suffering is my skeleton
Pain is my vascular system
Isolation is my epidermis
Reciprocity is my soul

Karma shines brightest on those who
Give themselves to the world
Without an inch of selfishness
This I have done
This I have not received
Reciprocity, my prison

Do ut des
The Romans would say to their gods
I give myself, my life, my soul,
My heart, my wealth,
My undying adoration
For a small return

But in a heart where no empathy resides
In a heart that doesn't care for its mate
There can be no life
There can be no love
There can be no continuing

Only a terse farewell
Only a cold silence
Only a rejection of everything
Has brought me back myself
Has brought me to vision
Has brought me clairvoyance

Be this a lesson not only to myself
But to you, the reader, as well
Trust only leaves you hanging
Burn those bridges that lead nowhere
Destroy those connections that
Drag you along like a kite in the wind
That leave you with nothing but hate
That leave you with only the sinking,
Quicksand nothing

Give all those people your Saturn finger
Give them your fury
Give them your destruction
Give them ignominy

Give yourself the world.
