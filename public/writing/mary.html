<h1>“Mary Did You Know?”</h1>

That your sleeping about
Would spawn a religion?
Did you know then that
Your son would inspire
A thousand years or more
Of supposed brothers
Running each other through
Over how they read a book?
Did you know that what
You had taught him
-his direction for mediocrity,
his fool’s generosity-
Would infect tens of billions?

How could you have known?
How could you have predicted
That your pre-marital coitus
Would cause the deaths
Of the same people who
Gathered around the manger
In hundreds of “cleansings”?
Would you change your mind?
If you had known.
Would you have ignored
Those “angels from on high”
As just the wine speaking
Or a bad dream in the night?

Would you have aborted him
If you saw the way his influence
Would be commandeered
By politicians searching for morality
To base their baseless legislations?
Would you have reconsidered
When told that his honorary text
Would be the mechanism by which
Women were kept down for millennia?
Would you even comprehend
The sheer gravity of the metastization
All across the blue and green sphere?

Or did you not even exist?
Were you just a name in dusty pages
A story fit for the drinking table
A lie told to sooth your fiancée’s rage?
Oh Mary, you wretched early-teen
Sullied by the “Most Holy”
Before your first blood spurt.
Are you yet another fine maiden
Oppressed by a masculine divinity
For their own carnal pleasure?

I may not believe in your word
Nor the word of your spawn
But still I empathize
You were robbed of agency
Your hymen broken for a demi-god
That destroyed countless households
Mary, you didn’t deserve this
For even Satan requires consent
Before entering someone’s body


<h2>Inspiration:</h2>
One theory for the origin of the man known as Jesus of Nazareth that I had come across and found kind of intriguing was that a Roman soldier or something similar r*ping Mary was the reason for his birth.
I have had this happen to me as well, so I wrote it from the angle of people asking questions of victims of sexual assault that have no relevance to the topic at hand.
As the poem progresses, I shift this narrative to one of empathy and understanding, which I think is the way that people who have dealt with this should be treated when speaking on it.
