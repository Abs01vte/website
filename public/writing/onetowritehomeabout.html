<h1>One To Write Home About</h1>

You make my pot boil over
Whether it's the taste of your love
Or the scent of your heart,
I cannot tell

You make me burn higher and hotter
Your words are gasoline
And your breath stirs the tendrils,
Without thought

You're the only tangible thing in this world
As far as my hands are concerned
The center of your irises
Are my whole vision

You make me don my shield and armor
Sharpen my spear and pray for homecoming
Foreign or domestic, it doesn't matter
My body and life are yours to dispose

The vultures of soldiers long fallen
Circle above me and seek my debitage
My corpse, his corpse, anyone you need removed
I shall fight

I present to you:
My life, my heart and my future
Forever to have and hold
Your choice

For I know what I shall do
I certainly will have protected the princess of the castle
From the barbarians at the gates
All for you
