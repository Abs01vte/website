<h2>Three Rights Make a Left</h2>
Worthless.
Is there anything else to really say?
I could sit here and explain it all day.
Worthless from the debts in my bank,
To the halls of the idiots where I surely rank
Among the greatest charlatans of false intellectâ€“
If ever someone cared to waste time on my idiolect.

Useless.
For me: to write is a gift and a curse;
Knowing that everything I do will always be worse
Than any other monkey with a typewriter.
That I think, nay hope, what I have is brighter,
More vibrant, more cogent, more powerful to read
But what I've written inevitably leads 
To questioning everything I've ever said and done;
Since I wield the subtlety of a Gatling gun.

Directionless.
I ask myself: how can I afford a home
When my best source of income is getting a loan
And digging myself into a deeper hole?
Everything I could do is without a goal
Beyond just getting more cash to flow,
And getting me to do it is begging the wind to blow.

What is next?
What do I do when I inevitably crash,
When what I write next is burning trash?
Do I get back up? Do I try it again?
Wash the hog's wallow from my back and grin?
Think to myself: aye, this one may be bad 
But at least in doing it, I don't feel as sad;
And worthless, and useless, and directionless
As I did before.
