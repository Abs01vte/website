<h2>Blue Bullets (2021)</h2>
<p>
  “... I mean just fucking blow my brains out, right? Take those broad white canvases behind your head and just absolutely turn it into a picasso of grey and red splotches! If I do it, my only regret is that I won’t be able to hear the screams of terror and the piles of retch that would result from my discovery.”
</p>
<p>
  “You’re really fucked up, you know that?” A man in a suit, lounging in a veneered mahogany leather chair, slings at the disheveled pauper. “But,” he waves his hands in front of him, “we can provide you with the weapon and enough of the knowledge to perform your art. Although, how much more do you need to know than the round end goes in your mouth and the crescent gets pulled away from you to finish it?”
</p>
<p>
  “Not much, Boss,” a white shirt, black vested and black fedora bearing lackey answers from below his brim and off the wall.
</p>
<p>
  “On second thought, why not just take my wallet and you guys just do it for me?”
</p>
<p>
  “Why not?” The Lackey snaps.
</p>
<p>
  “Sure thing, champ,” the Boss waves his right hand and plunges it into his breast pocket, withdrawing a silver Walther PPK, engraved with small coffins, skull ‘n crossbones and death roses.
</p>
<p>
  A white avian human woman flutters down from a circular light in the floor, to the right of the disheveled man. To his left, a black humanoid with fiery eyes and two, curved horns rises up a magmatic rift in the ground that closes as his feet return to the ground level. Time freezes; the Boss and the Lackey stand as statues in their positions preparing for the "assisted suicide".
</p>
<p>
  "My child, for what reason did you seek out these low-lifes? Was it really to expedite your passing?" Angel reverberates in Pauper's skull.
</p>
<p>
  "Alright, goody-two-shoes. That's enough of your preaching." Demon turns to Pauper, "I can absolutely make a deal with you so that you can experience the shock people share on your passing."
</p>
<p>
  "He lies to you, Son of God, his deal is that no one will notice your corpse and you will rot without a single soul knowing that you have perished."
</p>
<p>
  "Lie? I never said that anyone would actually attend, but hey," it smiles with malice that bathes the room in darkness, "good on you for reading the fine print."
</p>
<p>
  “Is there a point in this discussion where I can actually decide for myself?”
</p>
<p>
  Both Angel and Demon laugh at Pauper.
</p>
<p>
  “Free Will? In God’s Kingdom? Would never happen,” Demon shoots at Angel.
</p>
<p>
  “Freedom from enslavement? In Satan’s Cavern of Calamities? Not feasible,” Angel retorts.
</p>
<p>
  “Why are you guys even here if all you’re going to do is argue? Arguing over the faults in the opposite logic and aesthetic serves nothing for the reason that I no long desire living.”
</p>
<p>
  “And what reason would that be, Shard of Light?”
</p>
<p>
  “What else is there to do when everything you do, see, experience or feel is meaningless? Things that you could even potentially be interested in already boring you with tedium of precogniscience of what I could learn. And if therein be novel information, what say you when that novelty is just as indifferent as holes boring gaps in clothing? Wherein be thy reasoning, thy ethical panacea? Surely in Puritan circles, this interpretation would be considered gold.
</p>
<p>“I submit to you that if everything in this life is meaningless inherently, and since both of your presences are known, thought about and in some probability are real, then you and everything you preach are meaningless therefore!” Pauper turns to Demon, “You seem to draw the masochistic type, but what I’ve found is that they’re no more masochistic than the ones that follow the Big Man behind Angel. I submit to you that if you seek to put people in early graves to torture them for an indefinite amount of time, as a counter point to Angel’s wish to see people live ‘long, fulfilling lives’- as if such a thing ever existed-, then what you say is merely a foil to what Angel has to say and is valueless therefore.
</p>
<p>“In summation, if everything is just as meaningless as its opposite; if every black sheep that’s scorned and left to rot by the rest of its supposed pack is meant to endure isolation as much as the pack is meant to endure mediocrity, then what is the purpose of it all anyways? At this point, my bar is so subterranean, yet I’m still let down at every opportunity. And it just makes me wonder, how fucking deep am I? How far did I get fucking buried? Did some past body get handled by fucktards who never learned that it’s six feet deep? They just went with the nuclear option of the fucking molten nickel and iron ball at the middle?
</p>
<p>“And just one last fuck you before I tell you two to fuck off and let me control at least one thing in my fucking life: how do you seriously, in your fucked up worldviews, ever expect me to handle the baggage that I both have to carry from this life and also the baggage of my previous lifes? I can hardly handle the shit that I am given in my own life.”

</p>
<p>Pauper snaps fingers on his right hand, dismissing both the presences on either side of him. Boss mangles the slide of his PPK back, checking if it’s primed. Lackey snaps a 30 round magazine into his FAL, clearing and unhanding the breach. Lackey flips the FAL up into his shoulder at a point between the fore and rear iron sights. Boss wipes his fingerprints off the PPK with his pocket hankey and squeezes the death pill container grip, pointing it at Pauper with snake venom dripping off the petals of his death roses.

</p>
<p>  “Ready to party, whelp?”

</p>
<p>  “Very rarely do we get to kill a willing one, Bawss!”

</p>
<p>“Ah shaddup, will ya? Now then, kid, James Bond’s Golden Gun or Malvinas’ Revenge?”

</p>
<p>  Pauper points at the Walther.

</p>
<p>“Excellent choice.”

</p>
<p>“Man, now I gotta unload and clean this damn thing…”

</p>
<p>“I already tol’ ya to shaddup, now shut. Up.”

</p>
<p>Boss rises from his seat and gestures Pauper into a back room that smells of a butcher shop, but not of the bovine, swine or fowl varieties. At a spot right in front of the meat freezer, Boss stops and plants a stool. He points the gun barrel from low-ready at the seat. Pauper drops his rear onto it, taking a blindfold from Boss’ outstretched hand and affixing it to his face.

</p>
<p>“It does pain me to do this to you, you understand that? I take no pleasure from putting people down like dogs, but if that’s your kink, hey, here’s your long-awaited orgasm.”

</p>
<p>Pauper hangs his head forward, drawing a target at the center of his brain with his mind. The gun fires. The blindfold falls off of Pauper’s face. Blood drip-drops onto the floor. Pauper looks up in shock. Boss leans in to inspect what happened; and as he does so, his face morphs into a mirror of Angel. She smiles with eyes that tell very contrary tales.

</p>
<p>“You… are the parallel life that survived. Take this with pride.”
