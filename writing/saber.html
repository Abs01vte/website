I began my adult life straining my esophagus to clear out the thick liquid so I could see what the bottom of an empty liquor bottle looked like under the iridescent lights. Days would fall onto weeks where the only times I left my cavern of refuse and broken dreams was to buy more of that liquid which had become so… ubiquitous to my bloodstream; so populous that my liver hardly even broke the chemical down; so filling to my stomach, that a banquet of food was unnecessary. Just one more shot. Just one more swig of that brown fire water that lit up my system like gasoline poured directly onto a running car engine.

I spent so long curled up in the nater end of the bottle, that I forgot who I was: the kinds of things that swayed my heart; that made me feel alive and not just like a pile of clay that Zeus had blown life into.

Friends had departed from me faster than a baby bird shed its feathers at 2,000x speed. My family couldn't bear to see me taking a stick of nitroglycerin to my brain, so I left them too. New friends slipped into old, forgotten faces and hazy memories of laughs. New interests fell like the rains from the heavens. I had lost sight of meaning entirely. And truly, I still have yet to find it.

My only release from the tongue-tied laconisms that filled my mouth was and is long strings of words placed lovingly onto a paper. I filled my notebooks, that another's eyes would never rest upon, with my emotions: the strong, the weak, the lyrical, the loving, the hating, the isolating.

One day, I decided that enough was enough and I chucked the bottle onto the street where it promptly shattered and turned the pavement pitch black with the deadly drink. But in a weird way, I miss it. It was my only companion for the longest time. It was the only thing that waited for me at the end of my day, that was excited to see me flick the top off and loft it like an indebted gold miner desperately searching for something- anything- that could alleviate his dues.

This only caused me more grief. For where I once had a reason and a meaning- albeit one that is caustic and destructive- I then had none. All the crass thoughts, that were blocked by my slurring tongue and held in check by my lonely drinking table, spilled out of me one after the other until the few who gave me a hand out of the pool of broken souls themselves left in droves. I asked myself: "Is it really the drink that caused my problems?" But I couldn't go back to it. If I really wanted to move forward, find purpose and be something bigger than a laborer by day and a vomit-scented ethanol sponge by night, I would have to leave it behind me. I would have to begin my life anew. I'd have to leave behind not only my alcoholic knowledge, but the things that gave me life before it; everything I had loved or wanted had been tainted and stained like my drink coaster.

So I took up the only thing that had kept my voice from cracking- that had kept me sane: the pen. But the words that had flowed in me so effortlessly when I had imbibed, caught in my throat and choked out my creativity. That day, the last of my child-like wonder and imagination died. And it wasn't a placid death- a passing on to greater pastures at the end of a meaningful life: it was the death that came from abuse; from the uncaring hearts of authority; from my lack of respect for it and my desperate clinging, hoping that it wouldn't leave me like the rest. But I see now that it wasn't it who left me: it was me who pushed it away.

I figured that this was all part of growing up. That the de-individualization and the deaths of my dreams were the fodder for mature beings. And what do mature beings do? They get a job. So I pounded the pavement until I got one. I worked and worked until my body gave out, then I came home to crash before rising to do the same again. I lost the meaning for working along the way. I showed up just because I got paid and because I was scheduled. But the sinkhole in my chest grew ever deeper. What was I to do? What could I even begin to seek when all I was loomed behind me and cast its long shadows over the extent of my foresight?

I turned to controllers, keyboards, mice and monitors. I turned on my old consoles, I purchased new games and beat them one after the other. The catharsis of finishing a game that I had spent countless hours mindlessly playing lasted about as long as it took me to decide to buy it; a mere moment. On to the next adventure, on to the next money sink that I gladly slapped down my old booze money for. Who cares about the old friends I used to play with, who cares about the old me that spewed negativity like a fire hydrant run over by the fire truck? They are faint memories to me as surely I am to them.

<a id="two"><h2>II</h2></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>
The line for purchasing a revolutionary new system, the VieweR, stretches around several city blocks. I stand at the corner of a general store two blocks from the front door, about four or five turns of the line from the homestretch. Voices buzz and chirp around me; every person excitedly murmuring about the games this console comes with, what kind of new processing power the sleek visor contained and how the multiplayer function would work out. I don't care. It's just another short-term gratification to momentarily keep the crushing weight of loneliness and the deep-fried images of who I was out of my head for at least a few hours.

Gradually, the line drives forwards. One turn, then two. Three, four and the final turn towards the storefront. I'm here at last! Entry bells ding as I cautiously and quietly shove the door open. Salesmen dash between counters, the back room and customers, hurriedly pressing the unassuming boxes into ecstatic hands.

"You know what I want." My monotone slides out onto the countertop.
"Sure thing, boss," the associate replies, stepping aside to pull a box off the shelf. "That'll be…" he makes melodic mouth sounds, "$1,200."
"Easy," I tap my phone onto the register receiver, causing it to beep and then eject its receipt.
"Enjoy. It should come with about 10 stock games, but the online marketplace should have the rest that you could want."
I nod, taking my box and walking outside.

Slipping the box under my arm, I place my phone on top and hail a rideshare. A minivan pulls up after a few minutes and I wordlessly slide in and begin undoing the not-so-carefully-coated box. Withdrawing the magenta glass, surrounded by LED indicators for various means, from the casing, I try it on- just to see if it would even fit and better to know now than get home and have to come back to return it. With it on, everything before my eyes is painted a soft pink, but this suddenly gives way to black. A flashing dot in the center of my vision gives way to two, which grow to three. Then the company logo is emblazoned across the width of my sight. "OffenHeuzer- your right choice for consumer electronics," it reads. Return to black. Then, a world of light! Winds sweep down a grassy plain, stirring the tops of plants on its way to the bottom of the hill, I guess. Then, a dramatic fight between two gundam figures over a burning and crumbled metropolis. Next, a cat-girl that extends a spoon with some sort of rice dish on it towards me.

"Limitless possibility," the audio intro begins. I wonder if it plays audio aloud, but I haven't heard my driver complain yet, so who cares. "...That is the OH VieweR way!" A man in a suit strides from stage right into the center, "Over the journey with your new system, you'll find it to be incredibly valuable for gaming, streaming or even working! Yes, working! Playing and beating our games in a timely fashion will give you a chance at winning our jackpot for each title!" You what? I can make this my new job? "That's right! This is reserved only for our most powerful players, who dive deep into our mechanics and learn to exploit them!" He continues by giving me a tour of the features and menus of the VieweR and what it's capable of playing and how. "Oh and one last thing, all your bodily functions will temporarily cease while you are 'diving'- as we like to call it. Do keep that in mind. Happy diving!"

Black returns to my vision and my visor gets ripped off. "Hey, buddy, this isn't a bed and breakfast inn, alright? I been sayin' for the last twenty minutes that we are at the location you specified. Now git the fuck out!"

I step out of the car, fumbling with my stack of boxes, trash and the VieweR. Opening the door of my cluttered studio apartment, I cast aside the box and the trash. Out of reflex, I open the refrigerator to get another draft of the rare auld mountain dew, but empty shelves and lingering stains are the only things that meet my eyes. I slam the door shut, rattling the unwashed dishes clogging my sink. "Fuck this," I think, "just gonna slump and see what this jackpot system is about."

A sterile, white space, infinite in interior, confines my body- my, uh, digital body. I reach out my arms, turning my hands back over palms. They look so real that I instinctively run my hand through my hair and I feel every follicle, every strand. My body suddenly tenses, my arms lock to my sides.

"Now configuring body type…" a robotic voice narrates as the words trail along the bottom of my FoV. "Complete. Please raise your left arm at a 45 degree angle towards the west," it commands. I obey. "Complete. Please raise your right arm at a 45 degree angle east," and I again comply. "Configuration complete." The white room gives way to a platforming map; moving platforms with diamond patterns on the surfaces, stationary platforms that look like perfectly square towers of dirt and a slowly bouncing golden ring at the end of the track.

"Level One: Beginner's Control," an artful title cheerily proclaims whilst covering up the whole center of my view. "Alright-y, then," I say to myself, my voice sounding like an AI that had never truly grasped human vocal modulation. I slide my right foot back, stopping it on the balls of my feet and lowering my hips slightly. With an imaginary starter pistol's bang echoing in my mind, I sprint forward and fling myself onto the moving platform as it stops next to the starting spot. I land with no weight evident to my feet. Taking a few circular steps between my shoulders, I survey the next progression: two moving platforms that stop about half a leap from each other. My platform gently docks with the next, and I step onto it. It turns to the right, gliding towards the following step. I fling myself like a long jumper and touch down at the center of the brown diamond. It begins again along its path, moving forward before pivoting left. Another long jump and I drift down into the center of the golden ring; shooting confetti out of all sides and slowly falling around me. "Great, who's gonna clean this up?" As soon as I speak, the system does a drumroll of dings. "Congratulations! Fifty coins have been added to your account!" This clears and a popup window covers the game, "Sign Up now to receive additional benefits such as double coins and automatic entry to cosmetic raffles!"

I hit X. The window closes and I'm brought back to the sterile, white room. "Snap with your right hand to bring up the menu!" The robotic voice tells me. "Kind of tacky, couldn't that have been a HUD option?" I snap. "What kind of bullshit ass-" A galaxy unfolds before my sight; each planet, a different game. 10 planets are vibrant with colors, climates and orbits but several thousand are only visible in the slight distinction between grey and black. The system prompts me to enter a flashing shopping bag. "If only this tutorial would end soon," I say, lazily entering the shop.

A shopping mall, clad in pastel pink, purple and blue painting and lighting, fills the empty space around me; outlets hosting things like Digital Downloads, Cosmetics, Character Model Editing, Barber Shops, Digital Assets and a Casino. I traipse into the store offering the games, seeing how much the 50 coins I received are valued.

The store is broken down into sections based upon genre. I amble over to the area denoted as "strategy" and find classic games like Chess, Command and Conquer, and other 90s to early 00s games offered for free. I go ahead and download the chess game as well as a series called “Total War” and a bar appears in the top right of my FoV, slowly trekking its way rightward. The chess game finishes first, so I hop into it.

My body disappears into shards and strands of light that re-coalesce into a poofy leather chair across from a 50s imagining of a robot. The empty checkerboard sits between us. The robot perks its head up, reaching out both arms with closed fists. I tap his left hand, which he opens to reveal a white pawn. The pieces rise from the board into their standard places. “White to move,” sits at the top of my FoV. I pick up the pawn in front of the right hand bishop and move it one space. The robot moves the pawn in front of his queen two paces. I move the pawn in front of my right hand knight two spaces. The robot responds by moving his queen to the right edge of my side of the board. “Game over: Checkmate!”

“What?! You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me! I got not two fucking moves and I already lose the damn game! I could just-...” Animated spit drops spew forth and rain in frothy bubbles upon the chessboard.

I hurriedly tap the “retry” button. This time I move the pawn in front of my king two spaces. The robot thinks for a moment before pushing his king pawn directly in front of mine. I notice that I can move my bishop to a square on the same rank as my pawn, so I do. The robot replies by moving his right hand, my left hand, knight onto the battlefield. I move my queen from the back rank out to in front of my pawns. He defends his pawn in the center. Here, I stop for a moment and consider what is before me. A thought strikes me in the back of the head with a cinderblock. I take his pawn with my queen, covered by my bishop. The robot bows his head, “Game Won: Checkmate!”

“Get fucked, idiot. Who taught you how to fucking play, huh? The fucking…” I don’t know any chess people to compare him to, so I just make monkey noises at him; roar a thunderous roar for having beaten the bot in a game that cost me no money; beat my chest with both fists and make a complete ass of myself.

My visor beeps and the screen shuts off, returning me to a vision of my apartment ceiling, magenta stained. I slide it off my face and see that the time is early morning. I plug it in and fall back asleep.

<a id="three"><h2>III</h2></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>
My body drops down from the sky in strands of light, forming my avatar in the chair at the chessboard that I had left before going to bed. I snap my right hand and leave the simulation. Back to the marketplace to see what’s available.

The double staircase entryway onto the sales floor hides their steps below the rendering distance of the faraway lit-up market stalls, all but a gentle touch of indigo lighting; the result of neon pink and blue meshing. Wine-colored bricks form the stairs; large pavers giving way to smaller slabs which sober feet mindlessly turn into a landing pad for the balls of their feet, and where drunken feet slip off the edge resulting in a crushing blow to the head. Almost out of instinct, I take a leap that feels like it takes forever to end, but suddenly my feet return to the floor.
“No PvP in safe areas!” the automatic system warns me.
“No PvP, my fucking ass. I just took fall damage,” I protest to AI.
“No back-talk,” the PA system warns me again.
“Fuckin’ fine, then.”
“No cursing either.”
“‘No cursing either’,” I taunt.

I mutter obscenities under my breath as I walk into the area where the games, avatar editing and gambling is located. Which isn’t actually the whole of the marketplace, as a near infinite number of stalls lay blackened and empty. I bow my head as I enter the Barber Shop. An AI, designed to be reminiscent of the barber shops of old, drifts over to me and passes along its programmed greetings.
“What’s up, bro? How much does it run a dude to get this ol’ mop cleaned up?” I inquire.
“Processing… Approximately, 10 coins.”
“‘Approximately’? What, you don’t know?”
“Requisitioning relevant data…” its eyes go blank and its mocha skin pales to a light beige. “Relevant data retrieved.” A real human’s voice reads off to me, “it depends on the style and length.”
“Ayo, wait just a moment. You’re telling me that you could totally have been a real human this whole time, but you’re using this Stephen Hawking-esque fuck-bot to reply?”
“Language.” the robot warns, like the others.
“So you’ve chosen the British way then, you bloody wanker.”
The human’s voice returns, “All real human voices are pre-recorded,” it repeats, and repeats and repeats.
 “I got you the first time you good-for-nothing stack of fake 1’s and 0’s… you bucket of bolts, you!”
“What can I do for you today, sir, madam or non-binary person of repute?”
“Show me your options.”
“Affirmative.”

My vision is filled with a whole collection of hairstyles, ranging from the poofy, large hair of 40’s fame to the shaved sides and long tops of the early 00’s. One in particular catches my eye. It is a recreation of Vikingr hair styling; like a french braid but with three sets of three braids all braided into one. Its name: Warrior’s Knot.

“Let’s go with the Warrior’s Knot. How much does that cost?”
“10 gold pieces, sir, madam or non-binary person of-”
“Yeah, yeah. Let’s go with that one,” I interrupt.

The numbers of my coins in the bottom right of my FoV drop from 50 to 40 in a moment. Just as quickly is the redesigning of my avatar: disappearing into shards and then returning in third-person view to show off my new look. I do a couple of turns to see all of my hair. It’s satisfactory.

“Transaction complete,” I mock the robot’s inflection.
“Transaction complete,” it replies.
“Ay! Don’t copy me when I’m mocking you, you daft-”
“Language!”
“Ah, f- off!”
“Verbal language filtering applied to: PLAYER#215783904.”
“Ha! You ain’t did sh- you right bas-! Hey! Give me back my ability to call you a daft f-ing c-!” I stare at the robot in disbelief. “B-!”
“Thank you for shopping at [Martin’s Barber Shop].” Its voice gets even more robotic when saying the shop name, if that’s even possible. “Please have a nice day and come back soon!”
“No I f-ing won’t, c- a- b-!”

Next on my list is visiting the Avatar Naming section of the Character Model Editing facility. Inside, a simple keyboard and finger scanner await me. I place my middle finger of my right hand on it, just to fuck with the system.
“Please place a valid finger on the scanner.”

I groan, putting my pointer finger on the scanner. It lights up a brilliant green and the keyboard projects a form above it. “Input desired name change here:” the prompt reads. I think for a moment about all of the usernames, handles and gamertags that I have played under over all my years of gaming. I am struck by the memory of a name that I had forgotten I used from back in my days of playing Call of Duty; which has unfortunately long since swirled the drain and plunged into the sewers. My fingers fly from key to key, muscle memory from the years of both gaming and writing coalescing into a quick typing of the user: “MadladxX42069Xx”. I stare at it, unhappily. “Okay not that one.” I erase it and type: “KingOfKings”. Also no. I retype a different name this time: “Absolute”. Now there’s the ticket. I hit enter and the system processes, before giving me the same third-person tour of my avatar but with a focus on my username above my head.

I leave the store, walking back to the Digital Downloads shop, in hopes of maybe buying one of the games that could net me some real cash! Inside the shop and behind the counter stands another avatar. I wave at him and walk to the area with all of the paid-for games. There’s one that came out in the previous month, and it seems to have been intended entirely for the VieweR: called Galactic Conquest. Fleets of starships slauch salvos of glowing plasma at each other, clannames embroider every ship and username, and fighter-class vessels zip between the lumbering battleship-class vessels as they exchange salvos of their own in a bouquet of explosions and death. I want in. Everything about this trailer screams from the screen- or I guess the GUI- at me and drags me by my trachea into the world of extraterrestrial aeronautic combat. I tap a green button asking, begging me to add it to my cart. I relent. Walking over to the counter with the cart complete given my tastes, I navigate prompts authorizing that I am, in fact, Absolute. A warm tone plays letting me know that it’s all paid-for. Yes, I am aware, I went into the paid-for section of the store. Age verification. Finally, processing and downloading.
