Under the Gaze of the Emperor

The ground rattles from the rhythmic footfalls of thousands upon thousands of people. The room I sit in is bereft of all light, just a few torches hanging on the walls or the gates to allow air circulation illuminate the cages and chained bodies. Slowly, the rattling slows, giving way to the muted sounds of the event organizer explaining the next engagement to the enraptured audience, hardly reaching the fighter staging area through the feet of solid rock. I shake my wrist restraints, jingling filling the air to attract the guards. A metal-plated guard jogs over to my cell, sliding the door open and inserting the key into the metal bars keeping me docile -or so they'd like to think. I rub my wrists where they once were confined, itching and complaining about the change in environment. You're going to have to deal with it, my precious arms, for far worse pain awaits us. The guard moves out of the way to allow me access to the hallways, dug from the earth during the construction on this megalith to killing and suffering.

"Rovix, pleasure to see you!" My owner smiles as I walk up to the contestant entry ramp.

"Dominus," I point my face down and begrudgingly show my deference, "what role am I slated to serve on this fine fighting day?"

"Murmillo. You can choose from the Gladius, Gladius Hispanesis, or this rare Spatha," he explains, grabbing the nearly six foot blade and turning it over to observe the battered flat and chipped edge.

"I'd rather have a weapon that doesn't look like it's been used since the Battle of Actium." I pick up one of the republican-style Gladii, bathing in the glow from the pristine, iridescent iron. It appears to not have been used, but shown much love and respect; for, the steel exudes its strength, filing my arm and body to the brim with confidence. To think that my ancestors were run through with this very blade by the very people that cheer for my blood over my head. As penance for this nation's transgressions, I will punch through every man they send my way, the same way that my kin were shown no mercy. "This one should work."

"Interesting pick. Dual-wielding or are you going to pick from the shields?" Dominus inquires, pointing to the line of shields laying against the opposite wall.

"Hoplon, no.  Parmula is for a different role, so that's out too. The Thraex is too small for my tastes. I always like the Hastum." On the wall are seven or so shields with an array of colors and designs; a few that look like they're just from the front, another in Athenian blue with the owl emblazoned in white, a third with the stylings of the archaic Auxilia. I pick the standard-issue one, figuring it more fitting to what I intend. "A murmillo would be lost without his tower-shield, and I seek not to bring you and your familia dishonor, Dominus."

"Just fight with honor, Rovix, and you will do me much good fortune! Especially if you win! My Patron bet 1,000 Sesterces on you. So should you win, you'd receive 200 Sesterces! A tidy sum for someone of your -ah- unfortunate circumstances."

"200 is too generous a reward, Dominus," I spit, holding back my sarcasm as best I can. "I will do what is becoming my place, as I have sworn before the gods to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten and to be put to the sword. And the gods shall ne'er see me go back on my word."

"The oath only binds you in the arena, Rovix! You have the skill to rise above the rest and find a home in the hearts of all Romans, and from there earn your freedom! You need only go a few more winning bouts and I will do what I can to convince my Patron to convince his Patron of the proposition, since you will have earned him so very many pecunia by then, so he will have no choice but to grant it to you under the ecstatic cheers of the crowd!" He exuberantly spouts, his face growing the color of Mars from the exertion.

"Ave, Dominus, moriturus te saluto!"

The calls from the crowd swell as I am called out onto the sand, bathed in the scorching summer sun. I step out, glancing along the stands; the top two sections covered by the awnings extended from the walls, and the "rich" section baking in the sun. I chuckle when I notice this, drawing my blade and bowing before the Imperial box. The Emperor raises only two fingers to greet me, preferring to recline into his seat and have his servants fan him. I face my opponent, banging my shield in greeting. He responds in kind.

"Initio!" The call to begin.

I raise my shield and charge to the center of the arena. My enemy raises his Thraex in response, pressing the flat of his blade against the right edge. I place the flat of mine on the top edge of my Hastum. We circle in towards each other, waiting until we got closer to engage. I spend this time studying his gait; the slight limp and subsequent scar on his left quad near the knee, his twitchy shield hand and the sure hand that backs his sword. We are within five feet. He stabs forward, his blade bouncing off the sword side of my rounded shield front. I throw my sword arm forward, the tip of my blade blocked by his shield in a well-executed shift of guard. Impressive. I retract my arm and he does the same. He jumps to his right and stabs, with the blade parallel to the sand, aiming at my exposed shoulder. I swing my shield around and slice downwards with my sword at the same time. I catch his blade next to the handguard, the shock causing him to drop his weapon. I press the attack, pushing him away from his offensive tool with my shield. He glances at the sword. Then at me. Back at the sword. Back at me. He flips his shield to rest on his arm, the rounded bottom edge pointing at me. He swings it in an arc, trying to knock my sword out of my grip. I catch his shield with mine, shoving it aside as I lunge toward his exposed side. I slash across his chest, not deep enough to seriously wound, but deep enough for him to know instantly that he'd been hit.

He staggers backwards, pressing a hand to his cut to check the bleeding. He backs up to the wall of the arena. I wave towards myself, showing him that he will have to come and fight. He acquiesces. He runs towards me, stopping just a few feet away to kick up some of the sand at my face. I close my eyes, raising my shield out of instinct. He expected that. His shield crashes into my shin with a sickening crunch. I shift all my weight to my right leg, pain-tingles spreading across my whole leg. That hurt. Alright, no more games. I bash his face with my shield, sending him falling to the ground while clutching his nose. I mount his chest, placing my shield across his shoulders to prevent him from attacking.

I look up for the judgement from the Emperor. The crowd points their thumbs to the earth, chanting "vive, vive!" The Emperor carefully scans the arena to get the full picture of the audience's appeals. He puts his fist forward, parallel to the ground. He makes no motion for a few moments, then abruptly thrusts his thumb upwards. The crowd gasps and some members cheer. I can hear the pained sighs from the Domini of the gladiator, lamenting their lost capital from raising and training this lad. For a moment, I'm torn on whether or not to actually kill him. He is just like me, trying to survive and do what they can, even though this all is against his will.

I place the tip of the blade onto his trachea, drawing a bit of blood. I lean forward and whisper in his ear, "...and to be killed by the sword, dear brother." He closes his eyes. I remove the shield to allow him to cover his face and die a dignified death. He does so, nodding for me to do it. I press the iron through his neck and into the sand, blood gushing out rhythmically. I withdrawal the blade, his wounds pumping blood out for a few precious seconds, and rise to my feet. I wave with both hands to the applause from the crowd. The Emperor gives me a tight, practiced clap that lasts for three revolutions. I bow and retire to the staging dungeon, my Dominus overjoyed when I return. I ignore his praise, like usual, but graciously accept the coins he presses into my hand.

<i>Not a great life, but it pays.</i>
