My eyelids grow ever heavier, slipping past the tops of my irises before encompassing both pupils in the darkening curtains. White light greets my now veiled eyes, cracking and splitting unto undulating green slopes. Waves of green spilling out to the horizon, continuing endlessly to the deepening blue sky. Light from the sun breaks the clouds and showers over fields of wheat, golden and lightly tossed about in the breeze. The gentle hum of a car engine grounds my consciousness. Fine dew coats the inside of the windows while more steam pours out of my mouth, frosted panes fogging the view of a lapis metal hood shooting beams of light onto a gravel road. Oh. Right. I was supposed to go somewhere. I think it’s down the street?

I grab the gear shifter and press into the clutch, slipping it into first. The hum of the engine moves into a faint purr as I apply pressure to the gas pedal, steering the vehicle from what I assume is my house onto the adjoining street. I flick the rearview to get a glimpse of the house I pulled away from, but my eyes aren’t met with anything out of the ordinary. Or at least, it isn’t any different than the houses nearby. The purr grows into a growl, beckoning me to shift into second. I tilt my eyes down to check the gear shifter, clack it into place and glance upwards.

Mauve metal plating line the streets where once was pavement, the wheels on the car no longer rumbling, instead smoothly gliding right above the asphalt, held aloft by a force I can’t name. But, it doesn’t feel unnatural, I guess. From the street runs house after house; sleek rounded fronts with flush windows peering into lifeless rooms, measured plants cut carefully to maintain perfect symmetry, and sterile designs with little apparent wear or years to their make. Streetlights guarding the entrances to avenues off the street float above the ground, above even the fences cordoning off the yards that circle the domiciles; electric blue orbs shrinking as the light filtering in grows.

The engine begins to whine, begging to be let loose. Out of instinct, I reach for the gear shift, but once my hand taps the surface I shrink back to the wheel. My location is close. The air is filled with the scent of burnt meat, burnt earth, burnt something. In front of me expands a deep channel, dug out of the earth, stretching down far below the surface with platforms stacked upon each other to service the massive ships, with orange glass covering living cells and dining halls for the crews. Not knowing what these ships were meant to hold or transport, I pull the car into lined rows underneath a pavilion, dictating the area that cars should rest.

Turning the key and extracting it from the column, the blade crumbles into dust in my hands, forming a fob projecting a holographic image of my car onto my palm. Slipping it into my pocket, I stride through glass that melts and shrinks to fit my form, closing and reforming behind me with a whipping noise.

“Will a…” the pleasant voice of the PA attendee morphs into a guttural growl while reading the name off, then rises back to her natural range, “please make your way over to Flight Deck Charlie Zulu, onramp 3B. Thank you.” The recording device clacks, then goes silent.

In the absence of it, soft tones rise in volume. The music swells as I step onto the catwalks leading from the entrance to -what I believe is a spaceport- filled with ships of varying sizes and designs. I look up and gaze at the underside of the ship that I beheld as I approached; finding it getting filled with carts stacked to the brim with glimmering gold and offloading prismarine crystals exuding a seafoam aura above the top. As I open-mouthed gaze at the workers scurrying over the gangplanks to transport the goods the ships need to depart, a finger taps my shoulder.

“Ah, Colonel McDeary! Pleasure to see that you made it here early,” a friendly voice greets.
I turn, apprehensive about who might be behind me, “You’re… uh… First Lieutenant Zhang, right?” Colonel McDeary? Lieutenant Zhang? Who are these people?
A cheery face smiles warmly towards me. “That’s me! Do you want some Go-Juice to get your blood pumping, since you seem to be a little sluggish?” He rapid-fire shoots words into my ears.
“I think I’ll pass on Go-Juice. Do you have coffee instead?”
He laughs heartily, “Coffee? Now that’s a word that I haven’t heard since my days in Initiation School! Isn’t that the place where old Earthlings would go to drink that black sludge, uhm… Caffeine?”
I raise my right eyebrow in confusion, “You mean, go to a café and drink coffee, which contains caffeine?”
He waves his hand dismissively, “However that goes.” He produces an emerald cube from his coat pocket. “This, is Go-Juice.”

I reach my hand out to grab the cube and he extends his arm to place it into my palm. The first thing I notice is the solid feeling exterior around the juice; tapping it with my fingernail, it clicks and leaves not even a trace that I had touched it. Tepidly pulling it up to my mouth, after a reassuring glance from 1LT. Zhang, I drop it onto my tongue. As soon as the glass touches a single taste bud, the cube splashes into an extremely low viscosity liquid, slipping down my throat like water. A tingling runs from my fingertips up to my neck, once in my head clouding my vision with white static. A loud ringing digs into my ears, racing through the canals until it reaches my brain. 1LT. Zhang’s lips move, his mouth shape growing larger and larger, but I can’t hear what he says, just the bass notes from his voice.

White fills my vision, dissipating to reveal that I had returned to my desk, papers still blank and pleading to be filled with words.

<a id="two"><h2>II- Doin’</h2></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>

I move my hand over the page, gripping the pen while my mind churns. Words flow as the lines are filled with letters. Yet, my mind moves back to the place I had spent time in just minutes ago.

The bright lemon light blocks my vision, staining my eyes with ever-changing colors. I raise my hand to block the rays raining down and the parking pavilion my car is resting in greets me. I turn and walk through the liquid-glass doorway into the port, the whipping sound alerting the receptionist behind a desk to the right of the entry walkway. Her eyes flick up to look at me, then the tensity in her lips loosens as a smile breaks through. She recognizes me too. Why then can I not recognize myself? I wave and make my way over to the restroom to look into the mirror. Opening the door, the mirror against the wall shows a face that I have never seen, but the body is at least familiar to me. I push the door open and walk out again, seeing ships drift down to their designated docking levels.

My feet carry me from the restroom over to a glassed-in office looking down on all the levels of the port. I place my hand on an indented right-hand scanner. The panel glows shamrock and the door swings open. Stepping over the threshold, a desk covered in trade affidavits and acquisitions await my signature. Flipping through the stack of papers, I quickly learn that Earth is in contact with many other planets, quite a few of which I have never heard of. As I peruse through the pages, a knock at the door attracts my attention. The receptionist from earlier enters and greets me. She pulls out a green cube, which I remember to be Go-Juice, placing it on the table next to me. She waves as she departs, closing the door behind her.

Grabbing the green liquid and dropping it onto my tongue, it slides down my throat and ushers in this feeling of untapped flow. My vision distorts to the color washing into my stomach and my hands move all on their own; signing form after form, scanning dozens of transit lists to clear their goods and filing them all neatly into a cabinet that whooshes the pages off to some other place via blue-tinted glass piping. More fall from the roof, to my dismay. The light of the Sun grows and dims whilst I work, the orange tint washing over the ships, and beckoning me to rise and return home.

I push myself out of my seat, but my legs feel like boiled noodles. I reach my hand out to hold myself up on the door, but it swings open with little effort. I fall through the threshold and collapse onto the metal floor. First Lieutenant Li Zhang comes bursting from an adjacent office and kneels down to ask if I am alright. I shake my head. He waves over to Major Barrians, who trots from the gangplanks to grab my left shoulder. They both lift my torso off the ground and half-carry-half-drag me to the floor below us, into a room with a large, red cross over the door. The two usher me through and lift me onto this sterile white bed, lined with humming, beeping machines. As soon as my body touches the warm fabric, the screens on the machines start to display my vitals. I can tell that my BP, heart rate and oxygenation all look normal, but the other screens are displaying information foreign to me. Then, a white-clad man strolls from a doorway at the end of the room.

"Greetings, Major, First Lieutenant," he looks at me, "and Colonel. Are you not feeling well, sir?"
"Not sure. After taking my morning Go-Juice, my legs felt unable to carry my weight and I fell as soon as my bottom left the seat." I explain.
"Interesting..." He raises his hand to his chin, perching it there as his eyes glaze over in thought. He stares at each of the screens surrounding me, before his eyes return to normal and meet mine again. "The body is reacting within normal parameters. To be safe, I will need to take a urine sample. Is that alright?"
"I do have to whiz a little bit. Should I do it here, in front of the Major? Or is there another place I can fill the cup?"
"'Fill the cup'? No, sir, the bed you're on can collect it." He taps a button on a glass device he produced from his back, causing a small tube to extend from the bed and latch on to my -you know- draining my bladder. After a second or so, one of the machines loudly dings and the doctor glances at it. "Now that is very interesting. The body is excreting the active chemical in Go-Juice much like a normal user would, however the blood uptake is conducive to a first-time user. You're sure that you've done it before?"
Li speaks in my place, "I gave him one yesterday because he was being spacey, but it didn't help his confusion much. He seemed to be out of it all day, but today he has been normal-er, save for the weird collapsing."
"What he said," I agree.
The doctor's eyes narrowed after Li mentioned the confusion, "This addled state, how long did it last?"
"Well, when I saw him that morning, he didn't recognize me at first -or at least didn't appear to. He did know my name, but something was off in his eyes. It was like they were a different color. The Go-Juice seemed to return him to normal and he clearly made it home safe afterwards," Li explains.
"Hm..." The doctor grabs a thin tube, taps my forearm to bring my veins to the surface and inserts the needle tip into me. He clicks out a couple words into his glass device and out rolls a cart with the medicine in a nice baggy on top. "This should aid in diagnosis. I hope this will neutralize the Go-Juice so I can see if he returns to the state you mentioned or if it was, say, grogginess."
"Grogginess! I stayed up too late the night prior. Not sure how that would affect my body's reaction to this very commonly administered drug," I attempt to defend myself. From what, I'm unsure.
"Hey, doc, if Sean here ingested a liquid that hasn't been in use for hundreds of years, how would that change things?" Li asks inquisitively.
"Depends. What kind of liquid?" The doctor replies, while he attaches the bag to the tube.
Li glances at me, "Coffee, right? Oh, wait, you corrected me yesterday. Caffeine?"
"Caffeine is what makes it like Go-Juice, but the substance is coffee," I reiterate.
"Caffeine could indeed have some negative side-effects when paired with our green favorite. I'd estimate even a state much like you mentioned." He looks at me again, "how much did you ingest?"
"Er... none? I asked Li if we had some and he said we haven't had any in a very long time," I raise my eyebrow.
"Wow, I have yet to begin the detox and he already has returned to that state. This is remarkable." He types out a long report with both hands on the device.
"But, doc, what can you do for the confusion?"
"Not much, I'm afraid, Major."
"I'm fine anyways," I bravely say, dangling my legs off the bed before putting more pressure onto them. They hold up well and I'm able to rise to my feet once again.
"Don't you want your medicine?" The doctor innocently asks.
"If I can stand, I'm okay."
I push my way past the Major and Li, opening the door and trying to walk up the stairs I had been taken down. The door doesn't close behind me and a second set of footsteps raise the hair on the back of my neck. As I place my first foot onto the staircase, a hand lightly grabs my shoulder and prevents me from progressing. I look over my shoulder to see Li. He takes a few steps to be abreast of me. He leads me up the stairs and to the opposite side of the port from my office, into this building titled "U-ACE Administration" and beneath the abbreviation is the full name: United Astronautical Coalition of Earth. Li opens the door to the office and gestures to a black seat, glistening in the fluorescent lighting. I nod and recline into a very unforgiving posterior and back frame. Li knocks on a further door, which I assume to be the big-wig on site. He enters and quickly shuts it behind him. My body tingles and my hair rises; eyes are on me. I look around the ceiling to try and spot some cameras, yet none are around. Just then, the blinds on the door frantically close and Li strides out. Following him is a man in a spiffy uniform that looks more uncomfortable than the seat that my bottom rests in.

"Colonel Sean McDeary, it's come to my attention that you have had some adverse effects to our attention and work performance enhancing pharmaceutical, Go-Juice. We will need to do a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the adverse interactions between the chemicals you have ingested and the ones that we provide.
"Currently, we believe it to be the cause of an additive to the product: Lithium. While we add it in small amounts, large doses could cause some of the symptoms you experienced. Conversely, it could be on account of another trace additive to the product: Ropinirole. Either have the potential to have, eh, interesting interactions with caffeine.
"As we don't know much about the effects of caffeine beyond what information has been left behind by the race of humans that utilized it, we cannot truly know what causes these problems you've been having. Thusly, we'll need you to agree to undergo some tests to figure out the exact cause to better assist you in the future with your energy and production needs," he says, across a thin veneer of concern covering his haughty egotism.
"Uhm... I'm not exactly, uh, comfortable with going under the knife to determine the cause of a chemical interaction with something that I haven't ingested. Surely there is another way?" I plead.
"Unfortunately, there isn't. Your discovery in this area has illuminated my understanding of these products and makes me wonder about the means by which we can improve it! How can you not be proud to potentially rescue the entirety of the human race from the clutches of laziness and misguided ingenuity? Why would you ever put yourself before the good of Earth, and even the furthest extent of the human colonial planets in the universe?" He asks, a smile plastered over his lips and his eyes bearing a hunger for something, which to my eye appears to be blood lust.
"That's just it, sir. In the vastness of the empire of humanity, I seem to be the only one affected in this way, so why devote such meticulous care to the machinations that resulted in these issues, which don't even see as issues? I'm just tired. Maybe I need a new bed, is all."
"Potentially. But curiosity still warms the blood in my veins," he sneers.
"Then I know something that will make it burn!" I announce, leaping to my feet and forcing my way out of the door I entered through.

Both Li and the big-wig protest my departure as I leave, but their words can't convince me to return and surrender that which makes me me. My soles squeak as I slap my feet on the ground to put as much distance between myself and whatever devious machines or experiments they were planning on subjecting me to. I faintly hear the door open and the chasing footfalls, but they're too far behind me to catch me. I round the east side of the port, nearing the place that my office is, but I take a sharp right in front of it. I slow my gait, searching for the best ship to be a stowaway on. The orange-glassed ship from yesterday is still docked just a short distance from me. I look over my shoulder to see how far back the two are, finding them to be closing the gap and nearly in position to prevent my escape. I take a short breath to steady my nerves and sprint forward to that ship. I noticed it yesterday, and here it is still waiting for me while I need it the most. I have never had a reason to care about "destiny", but I think this is as close as real life comes to that fantastical idea. I slide through the offloading/onloading hatch and slam a button labelled "CLOSE" as the pursuing figures reach the end of the gangplank. The big-wig stares at me in horror as I shoot him a wink and a peace-sign. The hatch snaps closed.

I ascend to the flight deck via a cramped elevator and a couple flights of stairs. Once there, I find it empty, but still powered and ready to fly. I pull the chair back from the captain's control board and place myself into it. That admiral guy or whatever he is should really get a hold of the chair designers from this ship; this is a massive improvement. After a moment or two of staring at the array of flashing buttons and levers before me, I locate the ones that seem to be necessary to produce movement and set them all to maximum. The ship shakes and rattles as the engines roar to life. Below me, the big-wig runs around shouting at anyone who can listen to assemble a space fleet to stop me. Too late. I tilt the control joystick backwards and the ship lifts off the tether holsters. The port shrinks beneath me, filled with the growing amount of green landscape that surrounds it. Blue is introduced into the mix, white lines like brushstrokes denoting the currents and the waves washing onto shore. Before long, the beautiful colors of the Earth are encompassed by black, dotted with white. Then, even Earth is but a blue dot among the never-ending horizons. I walk over to the navigation computer to check where this ship is destined to go. Y-Wirona 54. Huh, never heard of that one. I hope it's fun.


<a id="three"><h2>III- Departin’</h2></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>

I recline into the captain's seat of a ship that I might have stolen, only a little bit. Stars and galaxies sit suspended in the consuming blackness of space; screaming out their presence and refusing to lose the fight against the dark. They remind me a little bit of myself, but a lot of the people that used to be around me. They all shine much brighter than I and are very easy to admire, even if just for their beauty in the universe alone, for their strength in overcoming the greatest test: time. Where my own mortal form can only last for -what, 80 years? 100 maximum?- theirs can remain shining for billions, and their light will still be travelling through the cosmos for another hundred billion. To Earth, they live for well beyond double their actual lifespan in the hearts, minds and eyes of the microbe-sized lifeforms that scurry along their mother planet's surface.

While thinking on my mortality, I walk about the ship; through the empty dining halls with their platinum white tables, through the long corridors lined with closed doors hiding living spaces, through the room filled to the ceiling with armaments to load the massive guns poking their mouths out into the vacuum of space and to a room, so cold that my breath steams in front of me, housing hundreds -no, thousands- of rounded cylinders with a glass pane on the top showing the frozen bodies of the colonists.

I yawn. The cold air is making me very tired. I just want to curl up into a ball on the floor and sleep from now until the end of time. Maybe that's how I live forever; I freeze myself on a frigid planet so that my body will never decay, never break down. I look around to see if there is any room for me to plop myself down and hit the "deep freeze" button, finding only an adjoining space for the officers. Stepping inside, my eyes lock onto an open pod. Bingo. The name-plate reads "Initiator" and comes with a built-in locking and starting apparatus on the inside. Hm... "Initiator"... I guess that's me. I lay myself down in the metal curve, tap the button and wait apprehensively as the door swings closed and the machine starts to hum. I fold my arms over my chest like the mummies in Egypt that I had read about as a child. I feel my legs go numb, then my arms and finally my eyes slip closed.

Next thing I know, the door opens again. Voices wash over my ears; quiet at first, but growing louder. My eyes slide open. My vision is tainted with excess water, blurring three figures hovering over me. I rub my eyes. The three figures turn out to be men in U-ACE uniforms. Thank goodness I'm wearing mine. Two of them grab my arms and pull me out of the pod, placing my feet back onto the floor.

"Who are you? How did you get in here? And why did we leave before receiving all of our allotments of unprocessed Go-Juice?" The first man asks, after a nod from the man with the highest rank.
I'm too addled to reply at first, but my voice finds its way out of my throat, "I'm Colonel Sean McDeary. I came in the way everyone else did, I guess? Through the door that was connected to the gangplank. Those prismarine crystals were Go-Juice? Sorry about that, but you can take me off the list of people to receive the treatments; it reacts negatively for me."
The three look at each other, the second ranked of them speaking up this time, "Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Colonel McDeary. I'm First Mate Alonso, this is Captain Grieflax," he gestures to the man who has yet to speak, "and this is Second Mate Conrad. Judging by your rank, you haven't had any training on a ship, correct?"
"I have more than enough training to get the ship in motion and on course, as well as managing all the products they carry. Why do you ask?"
Captain Grieflax motions that he will speak, "Because you aren't the Initiator. When we awoke from cryosleep, we received word from the man who was and he said that the ship had disappeared not long after he docked in Neu Vardein. He also informed us that someone with your name had bolted and boarded a ship like ours to escape from a simple surgical procedure. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"
"Uh... 'Simple'? They tried to send me through test after test to determine why Go-Juice makes me spacey. Blame was pinned on a substance that I haven't even heard of, let alone used, so that admiral or whoever is far crazier than you think that I am. Why don't you sit him down and question him as to his motives?" I exposit, probably with more incriminating information than I should've.
The captain looks taken aback for a second, then regains his composure, "Right. Great." He goes into thought for a moment, "Too late to turn back now. You know how to operate the ship, so that's good. You're clearly competent enough to have gained an officer's rank, and a high one at that, but you don't know Administrator Gorrens? You must've worked under him for several years. I'd be remiss if I didn't express just how unethical and confusing these proceedings are. But, you are who we have now and we're going to have to work together for at least the remaining duration of the spaceflight, so let's air our dirty laundry in the seclusion of this room instead of in front of the colonists and crew."
Captain Grieflax turns his attention to the First and Second Mates, awaiting their input.
"I don't like Go-Juice either. I don't blame you," First Mate Alonso states.
"Whatever the captain says," Second Mate Conrad dismisses.
"Strong opinions from my valuable subordinates." Captain Grieflax sums up, sighing before giving his piece, "I really don't like having a stowaway, especially not one who was on the lamb. Let's hope you prove your past wrong and you turn out to be a fine subordinate who does what I say, when I say it."
"Is this the part where I air my concerns?" I ask.
"If you have them, sure."
"I'm worried that you guys will jettison me."
The captain laughs, "That'd violate about five different Human Rights regulations. I'm willing to work with you, and these two knuckleheads didn't think you did anything wrong. I promise that we won't, so long as you don't go AWOL like you did 25 years ago."
"Woah, wait. 25 years? Man, that was a good sleep. Also, I can't sprint out of a ship in transit. With that out of the way, what's my first task?"
"That's the spirit. Come with us."

They lead me to the control room and I see a planet with salmon-colored land and a staggering amount of oceans. I'm tasked with keeping an eye on the engine heat level, which I assume to be a throw-away job that they gave me to ensure I'm busy. Before long, flames glide over the glass and bathe the room in bright, dancing light. The ship vibrates and moans as it descends to the surface. Then, it suddenly stops. The flames recede and reveal land stretching across the viewing portion upfront. Approach rate slows as we get closer, reaching a near standstill when the engines kick up small dust clouds. I, along with the ship, bounce upon the landing gear touching solid ground. So this is my new home. Welcome home, me.



<a id="four"><h2>IV- Descendin’</h2></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>

Out rolls the gangplank, followed by a small horde of differently-clothed people. I push into a green button hanging from the doorway; it starts freighting the goods inside to the ramp, where they slide down and form a semi-neat line of boxes and luggage for the colonists to sort through. I try to walk back into the ship, and up to the control room, but the Captain and the First Mate stop me.

“Woah there! This is your stop, sheepdog. It’s almost time to shove off, so shake a leg,” Captain Grieflax tells me, his arms crossed and an amused smile playing across his lips. First Mate Alonso nods, but at least his eyes bear some empathy.
“Was this because you guys couldn’t get your Go-Juice fix? Got the withdrawals?” I taunt.
“Yes, but that isn’t the reason. We can’t take you back because of your outstanding warrant. That is, unless you have 12 million Kaans on you,” he looks on as I pat my pants, knowing full well that I don’t even know what a Kaan is. “I thought so. This is goodbye, then. Good luck, Sean, and remember that the first food shipment will arrive in a year, so do your best to make the snacks last.”

First Mate Alonso waves as he follows Captain Grieflax back up to the main deck, shutting the gangplank behind them as they go. I turn away from the dust clouds kicked up by the engines. After a short moment, the hulking figure shrinks in the blue, eaten up by the thin atmosphere. The ship turns into a speck, then I can no longer even spot anything moving outside the range of the planet’s air cushion.

I feel naked without any place to call home, even if for just a single night. Better to spend a night in the elements in the process of building a home to call my own than to wander aimlessly, wondering why I have been dealt this hand. Out in the distance is the azure expanse, and with it thoughts of irrigable land on which to cultivate. Certainly with the additional benefit of utilizing the liquid essence to extract and reform it into clear, crisp water. Or at least, I’d hope so.

For, upon reaching the sun-bleached shores, the familiar scent of saline seas is absent from the air. Replacing it, a faint whiff of rotting eggs. Oh please don’t be sulfuric acid. I slip one of the standard issue gas masks over my face; the air had been oxygen rich near the landing site, but who knows what elements float in the air that could react with the sulfur evaporating. Not taking a chance with that. I place the urine transmogrifier on the crushed earth and extend the tube to the lapping waterline. Unscrewing the top-plate from the body, a machine encased in blue bubbling glass rests inside. I spot the control-connection-port and run the wire up to my glass device that I lifted off the ship.

The screen lights up, displaying the elements it can work with, but is missing sulfur from the list. Just regular sulfur could be useful. I could make gunpowder or some other manner of explosive to assist in the clearing of earth for my home. I run the output tubing to a spot that I figure is a good place for the foundation of my house. I tap on the glass to initiate the transmogrification process, seeing water come dripping, dropping, pouring from the end of the tube. Then, a small block of yellow material tumbles out of the “solids” slot of the machine. The chemical reaction chart shows that it also produces oxygen, which is a good thing to have handy. With oxygen being produced, I check the air quality monitor on the glass device and it processes for a moment before informing me of a “72% air quality index”. Over 70 is breathable, I think. I pull the mask off my head and take a short breath in. I can very clearly smell the sulfur, but it’s non-toxic. Could be worse.

I walk off from the shore and to an area overrun with foliage. I brush aside the leaves and vines to find a melon-shaped object. Pulling a knife out and scraping some of the rind off, I place the shard onto the analysis scanner on the glass device. Arboreal in nature, but growing outwards instead of up. Interesting. At least it will make good construction equipment. I slip an ax off my back and hack at the base of the melon-tree, carrying the dislodged body to an ore processing machine I scavenged from the stack of goods at the landing site. After a couple of button taps and a toss for the melon into the collection port, several lengths of planks pile up on the ground. I quickly get to work and furnish the frame of a single-room, single floor home to call my own. I cover the exposed walls with tarp, using the plastic-covered canvass to hold a couple hundred shovel heads full of dirt to finish off the roof. I wipe the sweat from my brows and walk through the opening in which I will fit the door. I set up one of the cots from the ship and tuck in for the night.

Not long after I laid down, my mind returns to wakefulness. I sit up in bed and go to slick my hair back, but my hand makes contact with nothing. I get fully out of bed, turn and see myself laying in the position I had fallen asleep in. Guess I’ll wake up at some point, may as well go for a walk in the meantime.

I hover just above the ground as I exit the home, seeing it finished and built into a fancy several-floor-high building. All around the same phenomenon happens; walls spring out of the ground and form building after building, road after road, car after car zipping through the once gravel-filled earth. Emerald figures walk along newly-made sidewalks, ambling aimlessly through the ghost town. From their midst, golden figures also journey by foot, stopping in buildings of the same color as them. Why the two different colors? What’s going on? I cast a glance over my shoulder and see the same color on the house I am building. Oh! So these are my kin. I see. Some force carries me along the road connecting my homestead to the landing site, which now is a towncentre complete with a bubbling fountain and towering Central Commerce building. As far as I can see, houses keep popping up and expanding the road network connecting all the towns and subdivisions, bringing the overall size of the two towns -now cities- to miles in length.

I am pulled upwards, beholding the lights that dot the landmass and the illuminated boxes of the roadways. As I reach the lower atmosphere, the cities merge into one large settlement and call out its presence as a bastion of human ingenuity and expertise in construction. Y-Wirona 54 no longer! Space signs denote this land as “Seansland”, an honor that my heart just cannot accept. Like a dog leash reaching the end of its allotted distance, I jerk to a stop and am dragged back down to the surface; past the landing site where the Central Commerce tower crumbles into dust, the homes adjoining the road being unmade the same way they had been erected and the streets losing their paved nature to the unrelenting force of the undergrowth. My body slides through the walls of my abode, the additional levels disappearing as I near my body. Then, my eyes align with the insides of my eyelids. I gasp to life in my bed, panting and sweating from the exertion of what exactly? I’m not sure.

I sit up in bed, jerked upwards by the cruel toss of a puppet master. It is still late at night, the suncycle is probably slower than Earth’s. I get up out of bed, after realizing that I had slept for 12 hours. Throwing on a set of work clothes that were piled at the end of my bed, I leave the door and fiddle with the machines that processes raw products and refines them into the necessary molds. As I set the last glass pane into the window frames I had built, I step away and admire the home that I made with my own hands. In that moment, memories of the dream I had the night before flood my consciousness, reminding me of how my antecessors will do the same. So this is how I achieve immortality; being succeeded by my children, their children and ad infinitum. For these people will be the ones to remember me when I have gone and to keep the flame that I had lit alight.

I sigh, take a swig from my canteen and continue about my work, reinvigorated with the visions of a strong colony of my own making plastered in my mind’s eye.

	I stretch my back against the upper portion of an iron-barred chair, a traveling crack sensation lighting up along my spine. I clutch my writing hand, to avail it of the ink coating and the dull cramping pains perched just inside my palm. Lifting the blinds above my desk, only the warm glow of the moon shines down on the landscape; even the streetlights refuse to be woken from their slumber amidst the white blanket laid by late autumn storms. Rubbing my eyes, the black and puffy protrusions under my eyes make their presence known to my fingers, but my body wants not to rest. At least not yet. Another notebook bids me fill it with my scribbles.
