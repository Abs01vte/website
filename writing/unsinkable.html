<h1>Unsinkable</h1>
“Up you go, tyke,” the spaceliner attendee whispers in my ear as he passes me from the carriage I was toted in to my father’s waiting hands, reaching out from the open gangway door.
“I’ve got him, Maria, your turn,” he says, swaddling my bundling tighter on me and placing a light kiss on my forehead. At his behest, she folds up the carriage into a suitcase by tapping a button on the hand-bar, sending it and herself up into the white airbus speckled with grey bits of shattered asteroids.
“Right, then,” the attendee sighs, drawing out an old-timey whistle to announce, “Last call for boarding!”

	My mother braces her hands over my ears as the engines roar to life, sputtering and cracking as their fuel is ejected out the back in a ball of flames. Lurching upwards, my stomach is driven into my intestines; ground giving way to churning, looping, drifting air surrounding the world. After another short moment, the Earth shrinks to a pale blue dot clinging to its place in the cosmos. Only the far-reaching expanses of void remain around the ship; lights from distant stars and galaxies the only illumination from the all-consuming black. Engine rumbling slows to a faint purr, signalling the transition to cruise. And sure enough…
	“Greetings, passengers! This is the captain, Captain Morgania, speaking. I wanted to thank you on behalf of Impregnable Discovery for joining us on our maiden voyage to the newly founded colony of Hatraxia. Please, recline into your couches and bed; the arrival will be in six days. Current weather in Hatraxia sees highs in the 70s or 20s celsius, with lows in the 30s or naughts.” He pauses to shuffle some papers before adding, “Our stewards will be circling the vehicle shortly to distribute complimentary champagnes!”

	My parents quietly sip their champagnes, staring at the ground between them as I swing back and forth, back and forth in my company-provided rocker. Whilst our merry band of family members spread apart over a few cabins ponder what to do to fill the five additional days, a large bump bounces the ship. Instantly, the interior lighting cuts and dim bulbs try their best to illuminate the dark fuselage. My parents shoot up in the seats, frantically placing their drinks onto a table and dashing out of the door to find out what’s happened. I start sucking my thumb in wait for their return, but many minutes pass without a single word from the captain or the crew. And without information from them, my parents surely would not return. I watch as more and more adults stream past the door to our cabin, stampeding to the captain’s quarters to demand answers to the power blinking. Another large bump, the adults being thrown to the ground by the impact. My rocker sways harder, knocking against the inner wall of the metal skin around the ship. Calm. Bouncing off the wall slows my swinging to a stop, illuminated by only the light of the distant stars. The PA system crackles to life, finally.
	“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. Please return to your accommodations, open the panel on the bow side and extract the spacewalk suits. Remember to put your own on first before helping younger passengers. This is not a drill. Return to your accommodations… return to your accommodations…” on and on repeating until every passenger has returned to their rented space.
	The door snaps open as my mom and dad barge in, throwing open the specified panel and extracting three adult-sized spacesuits. They withdraw two lower torso assemblies, slipping them over their legs. Next, their upper torso assemblies, gloves, shoes and finally the helmet. I can’t see their faces through the gold-plated visors, but they each grab the parts for one more adult suit, combining the extremities into a loose bit of fabric and metal. My father -I think- scoops me up and places me into the helmet, my mother attaching the body to it. The ship rattles one last time, shaking and changing vectors due to a force that I’m unaware of. Emergency lighting flashes red, warning something. Then, a rapid force sucking us from the fuselage out into the vacuum of space.
	My mother clutches me tight to her chest as our family and several other families float listlessly. Our pressed visors buzz, making me think that she’s trying to say something to me, but for whatever reason Impregnable Discovery decided not to put in communication devices to the spacesuits. I look down the length of the ship, spotting several holes in it gushing white gas out the breeches. After a few moments, the torrent slows to a trickle, then nothing. The ship drifts away, scattering bits of metal, dining ware and luggage into the area around us. A minefield of new asteroids forms, growing larger by each passing second. In the last moments of the ship’s electricity, red lights flash from the bow and stern. More buzzing from my mother’s visor. Maybe she’s trying to tell me that the red lights signify that the alarm has been raised, hailing all vessels in the area with a clear “SOS”.
	Nevertheless, hours tick by without any sign from spacecraft on their way to rescue the survivors. Mom’s oxygen tank begins displaying white warning lights, as does the rest of my family’s. After another minute or so, it displays a red flashing light. Her grip begins to loosen on me, instead floating next to me with her arms forming a broken circle around my emergency suit. Dad, sister, uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents flail for half a minute before they too stop in positions of terror. With this, I remain the last person still alive from the crew and passengers, at least as far as I can tell. I drift further away from the ship while my infantile brain tries to reconcile what I know and what I’ve seen, but I still can’t grasp what it is that happened to the people that I love and who love me. 
	And from the far reaches of space, a ship appears and decelerates until they come to a stop next to the floating bodies. A panel opens on the side, extending a net that is put under tension by a bar attached to the front of the panel; a rope binding the two together. The net continues to elongate before the ship puffs forward a scoot, collecting a few bodies in it. The front tension bar retracts into the exposed airlock, coalescing the dead into it. It snaps shut behind us. White gas is blown into the room, repressurising it. A few men stroll into the room, pulling off helmets and checking the inhabitant’s blood pressure. When they get to me, one of them turns to the others and waves them over.
	“We’ve got a survivor!”
	“Who is it?”
	“A baby!”
	“Quick! Get him to the infirmary!”
	I’m pulled out of the suit and rushed over to a room bedecked in white walls, white sheets on white beds and a single splash of color from a neon-red plus.
	“You’re going to feel a little pinch,” the doctor tells me, inserting a needle into my thigh.
	My eyes roll back into my head, driving me to sleep.
