<h1>56 Reasons</h1>
<p></p>

I inhale your scent like it's smelling salts
And I am deep in a comatose state
It's the air of smoked meats
On a cool Labor Day
It's the comfort of a mother's perfume
When your eyes are clouded by tears
It's the light fragrance of baking
That fills an entire home

I drink up your form like it's water
When you just left the desert
It's the reassuring feeling
That accompanies seeing your house
It's the way a construction site
Changes and grows every day
It's how your smile curves
With three vectors at once

I listen to your breathing like it's a phone call
That I anticipated all day
It's the gentleness of winds
That sweep down the hills
It's the warmth of the Sun
With a nice cool breeze to boot
It's how hearing you soothes me
And carries me to sleep, right behind you

I taste your heart like it's Valentine's chocolate
And one piece is just not enough
It's the umami in the symphony of flavors
That crashes its cymbals and shouts its presence
It's the mouthwatering sizzle and crack
Of a fresh plate of my favorite food
It's the end of a buffet
And you must have room for dessert

I feel your soul like it reaches out
And grabs me
It's the depths of clear, azure pools
Where you can see the shipwrecks at the bottom
It's like a whole mountain of pillows
Constructing a fortress in my living room
It's your fingers' snug fit
Into the gaps of mine
