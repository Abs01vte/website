<h1>Last Veteran</h1>

I am a protector. My CO told me to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. I served my country in wars foreign and domestic, but now I just stand alone in a field. I watched as the people rolled past my post, some looking at me quizzically, others taking my picture and driving off.

Years passed and I kept my post, always staring at the same road, which seemed to grow by the day. But it seemed the things that stayed the same as the first day that I arrived were the way the grass fluttered gently in the soft breeze that swept over the ground and the way that the birds seemed to hang in the air like pictures on a wall as they flew so far away.

Snow piled at my feet in winter, only to melt away like my glories as the time passed. In the summer, my skin would be too hot to touch and I was reminded about how my crew would joke about my heat when we served together, so very long ago. “Sherman,” they’d jest, “you’re so hot, man!”

One time, one of my crewmembers showed up to my post and tears welled in his eyes as we looked at each other after many years had passed. He gently ran his hands along my face and brought me into a loving hug. I was too powerless to speak (I had lost my voice after the War) and too powerless to move (I had no energy to move). Oh how I wanted to regale him in my stories of watching people pass by my post! Oh how I so desired to sing our praises together as we did on the battlefield in those days gone by. He waved some people who were milling around near the road over to us, his white hair dancing in the sunlight. He smiled through the tears of joy as he told his family of the times we spent churning the sand in Africa and rescuing the 101st Airborne in Bastogne. He pointed to my medals that were pinned to my chest, explaining what we had done to earn them. “This one we got from breaking through an entrenched Panzer nest in east France.” He pointed to a series of 5 medals along my body, which he himself put on me following the triumph. He straightened his uniform and showed his family the badge he got for beating the Germans. “Sadly, this guy here,” he patted my back, “didn’t get one.” His grandson looked wide eyed at me and then turned his curious gaze to my crewmate and asked “Why not?”

“Because tanks don’t get medals.” He put frankly, “Although, I would gladly give him one. He saved my life a fair few times… I mean look!” he pointed to a gaping wound in my lower back “this was from a Panzerkampfwagen IV and he took it like a champ!” He smiled kindly at me. “See this turret? You should’ve heard how he used to roar as we sent shell after shell into the German lines.” I fondly remembered what it was like to still have a voice. “It’s a real shame that he is stuck here, a landmark, but this way I can always come back and see him again.” He paused and looked down. “It’s a shame my crew couldn’t come.” His grandson asked why again. “I’m the only one that still can.” He said, doing his best to keep his voice restrained. “And I’m afraid that this might be the last time I can come and see him.” He rested his left hand on my side and placed his forehead on me. He chuckled a little. “Sherman, you’re so hot, man!” He teased me. He continued resting on me until his wife pulled on his sleeve, letting him know that it was time to go. He pulled away and tears ran down his face, this time from sadness, and tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat. “G-Goodbye, Sherman.” He waved gently and trudged to his car. I watched it fade into the distance, as the normal flow of cars zipped past me.

On, I sit at my post, guarding my land and my country. On, I will stay, until ordered otherwise.
