<h2>Humans Need Not Apply</h2>
A new fabric of reality was birthed before the turn of the millennium that all changed. This plane of existence is known as the Internet, and it encompasses every inch of the Earth; every hill, valley, river, up into the solar system. No longer do the fleshy, bloody bags of bones control the flow of destiny, now is the time of the server room; of the silicon control panel.

A ding echoes in the reception department of the virtual store: a new order. Robotic arms whir to life, extracting the products and sending them along their way atop the metal plate conveyor belt. Wires fall from the ceiling and rest upon the product, a suction cup arm lifting it so that a pneumatic piston can push a box underneath it. Placing the product inside it, the suction cup arm twirls and uses its two "fingers" to unstick, adhere and smooth the shipping information sticker on the outside. Travelling through the warehouse and joining up with the rest of the order, a waterfall of shipments cascade into a delivery container.

Confirmation receipt paper trails from its printer, meant to alert the human operator, but snoring from him instead informs the autopilot to scan the paper, requisition the original and compare. With a green light that defines "99% Accurate", it retracts and the process continues.

An autonomous forklift docks with the delivery receptacle, lifting it and turning to insert into an autonomous delivery truck. With this receptacle and additional ones filled into the back, the delivery vehicle pops off the air brake with a whoosh and revs its synthetic petrol engines. Exiting the facility and joining the queue of fellow self-directed vehicles, like a toy train set merging tracks, it speeds up to maximum velocity. To its left, over what used to be white stripes delineating the lanes of traffic, is an autonomous taxi; occupants slumped over in sleep, induced by copious amounts of alcohol. The delivery vehicle passes an autonomous 18-wheeler, sliding in front of it with such precision that a human driver would've long since crashed and burned on the side of the road. Pulling into the exit lane and towards its destination, the vehicle slows to a stop inside a designated parking space for offloading. A copy of the autonomous forklift withdrawals the packages and places them into a sorting machine.

On the other side of the facility, a drone begins spinning its propellers. It lifts off the tarmac and hovers at a point that its tethers to its payload are fully extended. An output conveyor drops the contents of the order into the payload, tapping the rope with an arm that locks into place at the end of the belt. The drone takes off fully; rising into the sky and tilting forward to gain speed. After a short flight, its onboard GPS alerts that the drone is hovering over its drop off location. Decreasing propellor velocity, the drone falls from the sky and whirs its engines in one last burst before coming to a complete stop on the customer's doorstep. A pulley system, tactically hidden under the rear booms and counter-balanced by an inch thick slab of metal, lifts the rear of the payload. A gangplank forms out of the forward-facing wall of the payload, dumping the contents neatly onto the welcome mat.

Inside the domicile, a dog incessantly barks in defense of the household, and inadvertently makes the family aware. As they spill out of their home, they exchange banter on the simplicity, speed and cost-effective nature of Amazone's service.

Carrying their goods into their home, a distant CEO gets a notification for $500,000 trickling into his account.
"What a great new system," he says, "in previous quarters, I'd have to pay $350,000 of the half mil' for wages and upkeep, but now all this money is solely my own!" He reaches over to his office phone and scans his fingerprint on a plexiglass screen. The antiquated dial tone fills the office, before another antiquated "receiver has been lifted" sound ends it.
"Hey, baby! How's work?" Happily chirps his wife.
"Oh it's fantastic, darling. I just got the money for that helicopter pad you've been asking for!"
"I'm so glad! The kids will be so excited to go on helicopter rides with their amazing father!"

On the road that can be seen through the CEO's office window, a wretched man lifts a tattered blanket over himself, to help his holey jacket retain heat. Not five years prior, he had been the Communications Manager at Amazone. Not six years prior, he had survived the first wave of layoffs. But four years ago, his whole financial tower crumbled to dust. Four years ago, the layoffs that had been mounting finally broke through the need for human labor. Four years ago, striking and organized protests choked the street he now sleeps on. Four years ago, a military-appearing riot control descended and spread its flashing lights and whirring sirens. Hundreds were left to rot on the sidewalk and blacktop, riddled with bullet holes created on factory lines that they had once worked, managed or supplied. He rolls over and checks his donation pan, finding that it has yet to accrue a single penny. His stomach protests his lack of sustenance. All he can do is rub it better from the outside as black clouds tower over the skyscrapers. Another drone speeds over top of him, getting in a last delivery. He yanks his blanket over his head in shame. In the darkness of his coverings, he sheds a tear for the family he had to abandon.
