<h1>“Sixteen in ‘16”</h1>

Telegram beeps spell out that the world
is again mired in needless, senseless war.
That even the red-clad men to our east
have heeded the call to slay a black beast,
towering over the blues and whites in arms,
without knowing that their own tyranny harms
our many peaceful, liberty-loving homes
unabashedly praying to crosses from Rome.

A green hand in my head beats and pounds,
yelling to remove the killers from our grounds
and return the young clover once though lost
amid the several centuries’ occupation cost.
“Gather black brimmer bearing brothers to rout
those black-and-tan-wearing men they tout,
from the emerald fields and rocky slopes
keeping quiet our free thoughts and hopes.”

My right hand shakes over the document
declaring our intention to use our armaments
in resolute defense of the city of Black Pools
until the flame of the red’s imperialism cools.
But I know that for this, my death is to be paid
and in this beautiful green earth shall I be laid
as a hero filled with absolute elation
who blew life into the subjugated nation.

While the blindfold is slipped over my dry eyes,
my heart never wants for tears or lamenting cries.
For, I offer the solid earth beneath my feet my blood
so that the green, white and gold may open a flood
of men willing to do as I had done before now
and finally kick off the merciless yoke that held us down.
But as the thunder washes over the body of No. 14,
I realize that my time left is getting quite lean.

The breeches clear and clack into place. The thunder returns and I slump forward, dead.
