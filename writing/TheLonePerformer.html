<h2>The Lone Perfomer (2016)</h2>
<p>
  The rope dropped from the top of the wooden structure. The man dressed only in black robes grabbed it eagerly, jerking it towards the man who stood alone at the center of the stage, the lone performer. He stood, his hands bound behind his back. He looked high into the sky, the lone performer preparing himself for his routine. With practiced precision, he looked at the wooden stage, the looping and swelling grains in the boards reminding him of the vast ocean churning or of the clouds dancing across the sky, constantly changing and constantly in a state of elegance. The lone performer knew what came next, and almost on cue a third man stepped onto the stage, nodding to the crowd that was gathered anxiously around the elevated floor, looking with grim fascination at the prospect of the lavish production that was about to begin. The new man nodded to the man dressed in black and the man in black handed him the rope. The lone performer’s head was pulled back by the new man, but the lone performer’s calm expression remained unchanged, he was merely going about the performance as he had practiced in his mind all those many hours in his green room which was surrounded by metal bars. The new man stretched the loop at the end of the rope, placing it lovingly around the lone performer’s neck. The strands tickled the lone performer’s neck and under different circumstances, he would itch it and go about his day, but he did not have that luxury, he was at the mercy of the routine. The crowd roared along with the performance, men and women alike cheering with sadistic exuberance at the addition of the rope necklace around the lone performer’s neck. The man dressed in black hit the lever for the lights and the lone performer fell into position. He looked to the sky again and saw that the clouds he so adored turned a shade of red along with the rest of the sky. The crowd’s cheering seemed to fade and get distorted, his stage fright getting the better of him. And with that, he slipped into darkness, the performance ending with a magnificent conclusion.
