<h1>Fatality</h1>

From the depths of the Shadow it lurches
Gnarled fingers dragging it to where it perches
Avian beak spreading apart in a wicked grin
Announcing itself as the manifestation of my sin
"All I require is that you surrender your life,
A few moments pain for lack of any strife
And you will know when it is complete
For you will sit right here in my evil seat."

With malice, its clawed hands grasp my throat
With hatred, its venom seeps into my skin
With no remorse, it drags me under
Deeper and deeper until the light disappears
My lungs burn for want of air
Bubbles, felt but unseen, trace my face
Released amid panicked gasps
Surely I could swim to the surface
But which direction is up?

"Submit," its snarls carry through the sea
With nary a bubble nor distortion
"No," I manage to squeak out
"Speak up"
"No!" I shout

Cautious breath, trace the bubble's direction
Calm strokes, avoid at any cost detection
Despite its attempts to impede my progress
I kick and fight and thrash in order to egress
It matches my vector, preventing my ascent
But I fight in hopes that it would relent
It grows bored and releases its grip
So, to the surface, I slip
