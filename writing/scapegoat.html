<h2>Hymn of the Scapegoat</h2>
Place all your maladies on my hide
For every time that I’ve been cruel or snide
Send me off into the woods alone
And I’ll take this fate with no cry nor moan
Even if all I am is washed away with the tide

From sparkling dew on my desiccated bones
To the crumbling green upon the stones,
The broken stubs of my horns guide me
Over the mountains, the seas and the trees
Back to the Zarathustrian cave I call home

The claws and fangs of the predators far away
Are easier to take than asking me to stay
Just to face another day of the dead past
As if my soul is solely for iconoclast
Begging for the king’s head on a silver tray

Aye, I would wish to see the kingdom lain low
Shatter that glass ceiling that won’t let some grow
But, am I alone in wanting this? Be true!
You would chafe if your floor was made of glue too
Forever stuck as a target waiting for the draw of a bow

Yet, here you leave me amongst the ruins of the King
Like I was the one who can only grasp and cling
To the empty streets and windowless homes 
As if my presence clearly gaums 
And my silent voice will echo and ring

So circle around, say your last rites and breathe me in
Pray for deliverance from your ailments herein 
Cast my body upon the bloody pyre 
Let all my goodness be eaten by the fire 
And know, dear witness, that the smoke is your sin.
