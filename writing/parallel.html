<h1>Parallel Lines</h1>

When I think of you, I burn.
Is it with unchecked rage?
Is it with unbridled love?
I can’t tell
For there is just as much that I love
That I vehemently hate about you

Your obsession with luxuriance
Aggravates me beyond all else
Without it, your smile stays aloft
Long after novelty would wear off
Please, put down your credit card
Achieving happiness isn’t that hard
But I’m too well aware the futility
Of trying to convince you to be
Infatuated with beauties of the world
And not necklaces that are pearled

Your opulent smile is all I need
However, your will I must heed
For you desire not my ideals
Nor my shameless appeals
I don’t know what attracts you
But I’m not it, that much is true

Good luck with your endeavors
And I hope you say that with mine
Erasing and destroying feelings
Is something I have yet to do
I guess this’ll be a first.
