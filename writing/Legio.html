<h2>Legio XIII Gemina: The Rubicon</h2>

<h2>I- Rising Sun in the East</h2>

The sound of hoofbeats on the soft, Po region soil piqued my ears. Suspecting it was nothing more than a traveler or a merchant, on his way to trade Roman goods with the newly conquered Gallic lands that I had gladly served Caesar in conquest of, I continue to sharpen my gladius. The whetstone glides along the surface of the blade, ringing in pleasure; such as a cat or a dog being rubbed along their stomachs, purring and wagging their tails. The sword hasn't been used in many months, yet it shines like the day that it was placed in my possession. Given to me by a face now long forgotten in a land far from here. Soon, I will have lived away from the land of my birth longer than I had before I left.
Suddenly, the horse stops. The air seems to get heavier with each passing moment, as if all the wind gods are gathering above me -- vultures circling the deceased. Then, like a rooster warning of the coming daylight, squelches of caligae approaching my domicile bids me to turn around. A smile tugs on the corner of my lips from seeing the face of my decanus, Granius! My glee fades to a mask that I wore in the legion, one of a hard heart and a ready sword arm, since a sadness hung over Granius' eyes, which I could only expect signified grave news. His shoulders, slumped after dismounting, rose to a strong posture.
I place my clenched right fist over my heart in salute, "Ave, Decanus."
Granius nods, pulling a scroll from his bag, "'Noting your previous service in the 13th Legion, 7th Cohors, 29th Contubernium, Gaius Julius Caesar extends to you, Publius Sentius, an offer of reenlistment to your former legion. Caesar bids you accept and aid him in his future struggles.' It goes on, but it's a yes-or-no question." He rolls the scroll back up, slipping it into his bag.
"You already know my answer, Granius." I motion with my head to the home Caesar had given me, "Give me three hours and I will be in full marching order. Where is muster?"
"Two miles south of here." He began backpedaling, "I gotta go, Sentius, see you at muster. Vale."
"Vale!" I salute once more as he mounted his equine companion and rode off along the road.
Creaking from the door echoed in my home around the lingering early morning rays, slowly sliding across the room. In a corner of the room, hidden from the lines of light laying along the floor, slumped my old armor, shield and personal sack. I can't believe I didn't unpack this yet, I think. Pondering it a moment longer, I realize, it's because I'm not home. Home isn't in a house, it's in the mobile camps buried under trees in the lands of the Belgae, it's in the tent that I share with my contubernium, in the  meaningful, yet meaningless conversations upon the ramparts staring into enemy territory.
Good for me, then, that home is a mere 2 miles away.
At muster
It had only been a year since last I walked through the Via Praetoria to my cohort's tents, yet I still feel the lares tickling my stomach as I approach the looming arboreal walls, with the glistening of helmets bouncing along the ramparts. Nostalgia washes over me like the mighty Rhine as I hear the clanging of blacksmiths over the hanging sound of thousands of men carrying conversations, laughing and giving orders. As this is a permanent camp, the roads were paved, causing my caligae to slap on the stones as I ambled towards my unit.
"How fares thee, Sentius?" the centurion greets. He scribbles something quickly on the wax tablet in his hand. Looking up with only his eyes, he points to his left, "You know where your tent is. Four of your contubernium have already arrived, so shake a leg and let's get working."
"Ave." I salute and hurry over to my unit's tent.
I jog past men cooking, maintaining their arms, and even some who are tending to the pack animals or ordering the unit's slaves to do it for them. As I near the middle, friendly faces hail me from underneath a tent. I slow my gait down to a fast walk, hailing my unit once I reach the entrance of the tent.
"Salve, Sentius!" Junius, my sqaudmate, greets.
"Salve. Who's ready to smash some Germanian skulls?!" I whoop and bang my shield, slung over my back, with the pommel of my gladius.
"Did Granius not tell you why we got reenlisted?" Marcus inquires.
"He read the beginning of the message, but not the end. He knew my answer wouldn't change. Why?"
Marcus looked at everyone gathered, almost as if he wanted someone else to explain. He sighs, "Caesar has been locked in a bit of a squabble with the Senate. Many Optimates have been calling for him to disband many, if not all, of his legions and step down from his proconsulship."
"What is Pompey doing in all this? Surely a fellow triumvir would help Caesar out!" I ask, incredulously.
"It appears that Pompey is ignoring this agreement in light of Caesar's overshadowing conquest in Gaul. I don't like this either, but it seems that Caesar may have raised us to be his closest force in case of civil war." Junius chips in.
"Truthfully so, but Pomepy has plenty of accolades on his own, I wouldn't see why he would turn against Caesar if not for jealousy." Marcus posits.
"Jealousy, maybe. I, for one, am entirely unsure as to how the situation fell apart in only one consulship. When we were disbanded, Gaul was secure and Rome was celebrating." I move to sit on a stool as I speak.
I notice footsteps to my right. "I suspect it has to be Cato who is behind this." Granius enters the tent and plops down next to me. He continues, "He's been at odds with Caesar since Caesar first hit the scene. Remember when Caesar walked out of the Senate after trying to call for a trial after Cicero captured some Catalina's co-conspirators? Cato must have not taken such a bid for clemency that lightly. Almost assured, he wishes to end Caesar's imperium to charge him for crimes that Cato views he committed."
"Would Cato have a case? Surely, whatever Caesar did couldn't have been too egregious. I remember the consulship of Julius and Caesar with much fondness." I comment.
"That's the consulship of Caesar and Bibilus, Publius." Marcus corrected.
"Pardon me. Yet, I don't recall seeing Bibilus doing much in terms of legislation or even of attending the senatorial meetings. Why then would it not be called what I said? For, if Bibilus were consul, why did he not serve his first month where he held fasces?" I retort, staring deeply into Marcus' eyes.
Marcus flicks his eyes away from mine, "He was still elected that year, so we should still respect the will of the people. Jupiter would not allow him to become a full consul without his full faith in Bibilus and his abilities." He finally meets my eyes again, "Would you question the judgement of Jupiter himself?"
"I would never wish to anger Jupiter." I scan the room, looking to see if anyone else wants to add anything.
An awkward pause fell over the tent, lingering in the air for several moments before Granius stood. "Enough yapping, we have orders to complete."
"Yessir." the contubernium echoes.

<h2>II- Embers to Flames</h2>

A breathless messenger murmurs, near inaudibly, to the guards posted outside Caesar's tent. Throwing the entrance flaps open, he quickly salutes Caesar as he catches his breath. Caesar gestures him in with a single finger, barely looking up from all of the governmental papers strewn across his desk. The messenger takes a few cautious steps. He glances nervously at the focused general, flipping through papers, scrolls and tablets, jotting words in the margins.
Caesar pauses, staring for one last moment at the tablet in his hand, before he places it back on the desk softly. "You, messenger, have you brought something for me? Out with it."
"The Senate has put consideration into your governmental extension." The messenger gauges Caesar's expression before continuing, "since it was passed in 498, the Optimates have argued that your extension ends in 503, sir."
Caesar holds his composure, but flames dance across his irises. "This is absurd! On what grounds could they possibly be basing this? Were it not only a few months ago that the Senate voted to allow me to run for consul two years from now in absentia?"
"This is not mine own opinion, sir, but the will of the Senate: 'the legislation from 498 granting Caesar five additional years as proconsul of Illyricum, Cisalpine Gaul and Transalpine Gaul never stated the dates on which it is effective for, thus it should be interpreted as beginning the moment it was enacted. On account of this, the Senate bids Caesar to prepare for the end of his office, presumably the Kalends of Martius, 503.'" The messenger looks up from a gilded scroll, handing it over to Caesar for him to read.
Caesar studies the scroll, his eyes flicking down the length, lingering for a moment when he reaches the bottom, containing the names of the senators in support of the re-interpretation of the law. One name draws Caesar's eyes. Who'd've thought, Caesar thinks, that a single "yea" vote would cost two generals their commands?
The following day in the Senate, one of the Tribunes of the Plebs, bankrolled by Caesar, puts forth a motion demanding that Pompey resign from his command on the same day as Caesar. Pompey, as standing consul, couldn't allow such a bill to pass, declaring “veto” before discussions could begin. The bill was dead, but the damage was done. Weeks slipped into months of a gridlock in the Senate between those who supported Pompey and those who supported Caesar. As the deadline for Caesar's forced resignation edged ever closer, the Senate was still wholly unable to reconcile which general should resign, with a growing portion who want both to resign mutually. But as February came to a close, Caesar still held that he would resign if Pompey resigned first, with Pompey arguing for Caesar to go first.
The Kalends of March deadline slipped over the horizon, with the Senate being unable to respond effectively due to factional infighting. The Caesarians attempted to bridge the gap, by putting forth a motion calling for Caesar and Pompey to resign simultaneously. The bill had few who voted "nay", and a peaceful resolution seemed to be within reach. Yet Fortune was not with them that day, as a rug was pulled from under the feet of everyone hoping to see the tension end; the standing Optimate consul rose to speak, telling the Senate that such a motion would leave Rome defenseless from Caesar. To this end, he nullified the vote by dismissing the Senate.
By the end of the year 503, the Optimates thought Caesar had long overstayed his welcome. Pompey was sent to southern Italia to raise an army to defend Rome, but those still attending the senatorial meetings weren't slacking either. They loosed another volley of motions to force Caesar’s resignation, with each being vetoed before a vote could begin.
On the Kalends of January, the Optimates gave Caesar -and by extension, the Senate- an ultimatum: Caesar must step down in six days or become an enemy of the state. The motion was vetoed, of course, by none other than Marcus Antonius. Vetoing the bill may have stopped it from being ratified, but the Pompeians treat it as law. The day in question came, with no word from Caesar. The Senate voted to put Rome under martial law, with the consuls made dictators. Before the wax dried on the legislation, the dictators passed their command over to Pompey.
When Caesar received word of this, he ordered the camp prefect to have the men of the thirteenth prepare to march south at first light.
Publius Sentius' perspective
"Any reason why the column is stopped, Decanus?" I call to Granius, over three heads. I rise onto my toes, straining to see what could be obstructing our path. A small river meets my eyes. A small river or a fast-moving creek? Either way, there should be no problem in fording it. By Jove, I could reach the other side by walking on my knees!
Junius turns about after getting word from the man in front of him. "Granius says that the centurion told him that Caesar himself halts before the river."
"Any word on why? Caesar has crossed many a river, so why balk at this one?" I hop, just to ensure that the river I saw is the same that Caesar stands before.
Junius turns back around, leaning around the man behind Granius. After a short discussion, he informs me of why: "Caesar hasn't received expressed permission from the Senate to march an army in Italia. However, the centurion is adamant that Pompey is raising an army in Magna Graecia." He hesitates, glancing at the lines of men adjacent to us. At barely a whisper, he continues, "truthfully, Publius, we may be the aggressors."
"Thank you much, Junius." I keep my tone in check to hide the thoughts swirling in my head from spilling out. Aggressors against whom? Against Pompey? With Pompey being dictator, wouldn't that mean that we are marching against the will of the Senate? Such a treason is unlikely to sit well with the gods. I may be fighting Jupiter himself, if I accompany.
Dust began to hang low on the ground, paired with the stomping of hundreds of feet; we march again. I wade into the fording spot, the water laps against my upper calves -never reaching above my knees- with a current light enough to sail toy boats on and still manage to recover them. I step onto the southern shore, apprehension building in my muscles and my gut, sloshing water onto the pebbles underfoot. First steps into Italia, ne? Let the die be cast.
The sun has long since dipped below the Apennines as we stride under the gates of Ariminum. My numb feet remain a slave to the rhythm of the march. Horns continue to sound the marching beat, even while the northern half of the city falls away to reveal a marketplace. Empty and closing stalls remain, their goods packed and carted off. What few people still amble the cobbled streets do so with an urgency; hustling off to return home or imbibe.
Torch-lit streets funnel our stomping mass to a spot, draped in the shadows of the walls, for tired bodies to find a place to lie until the morning sun beckons them again. Centurions speed between slowing cohorts towards the camp prefect. As quickly as centurions arrive before the prefect, they salute and leave, journeying back to inform their units of the arrangement. Our centurion returns, leading us off to the block. A room, void of any adornments aside from the odd straw of hay lurking in the corners, greets me as the door slides open. I slide my bedroll off of my bag, the sound mirrored as my comrades do the same. I roll my linens out, slumping onto it with a sigh. Something lands next to my chest with a soft thump. Rolling over, my bread ration, courtesy of Granius, greets me. Rumbling overtakes my abdomen, begging to be satiated. I conquer my bread with bites larger than Jupiter's member. With each gulp of the wine infused water, my eyelids grow heavier. They finally close amidst some new recruits talking about the lay of a local barmaid.
Someone kicks my thigh. Bright light. Morning. I rub my eyes. Once they readjust, I look up and see Marcus towering over me.
"It's the first hour. Get up. It's time to get marching," he growls, glaring over the bags under his eyes.
"Understood." I break eye contact and hop up to my feet.
Hundreds of feet shuffle down the stairs and out the entrance of the insula that we resided in for the night. I barely attempt to walk, since my comrades eagerly push me ever forwards through the door. Stepping across the threshold with my right foot, I follow the tide through the streets and back to the forum. I gaze out across men filling their ranks as the morning sun sparkled on the dew atop market canvases. Before the cohorts sits a temporary rostra. Five chairs sit empty upon it- three more than what would be necessary for the legion's prefect, tribune and legate to speak. Three additional officials? Have the other legions from Gaul caught up?  My eyes trace the tops of the formations in search of my cohort's Signifer. I spot him at stage right, adjacent to the sixth cohort.
"Salve, Junius," I greet, grabbing his wrist and shaking it.
"Salve to you, my friend! Glad to see that Marcus managed to wake you. Sleep well, I hope?" He claps the back of my neck, studying my face and eyes.
"Like baby Hercules. The early light eludes my memory, though waking at the first hour is no more late than Caesar himself rises." I glance at the rostra, still vacant. "Any word on when Caesar will speak or what it is about?"
Junius furrows his eyebrows, glancing towards his right foot. Meeting my eyes again, he answers, "not that I've heard. We have marching to do, so I believe it should be close."
"Ranks remain empty. Caesar must be waiting for them to be filled before rising to the stage,” I say, circumspecting for a glimpse of Caesar's bodyguard. Yet, my search was as fruitless as searching for a fig amidst falling snow.
After some time, men filed out of an alley to my right. Two lines quickly formed on either side of the illustrious general, wordlessly slipping from position to position until he ascends the stage. Behind Caesar trails our prefect and tribune. The additional three ascend a moment after the legion's officials and took their seats in the middle. They wore well-kept togas with a stripe denoting their office as Tribunes of the Plebs. Isn't it illegal for Tribunes of the Plebs to leave the city during office? How are they allowed to be here? Caesar stepped forward, gesturing for the legion to be quiet.
"Legion Thirteen, I bear sad tales from Rome. Behind me sit Quintus Cassius Longinus, Lucius Marcius Philippus and Marcus Antonius. All three men have been chased from the Senate -and even Rome itself- by those same men who corrupted Pompey's heart! Alienating him from our sacred pact and driving me to where I stand! Like before the blood-soaked reign of Sulla, these men, burning with jealousy hotter than the sun itself at the laurels you men bestowed upon me, are raising troops in Magna Graecia without approval from the Senate! And so, it is without the approval of the Senate that I must march south and put their tirade to an end!
"It is my solemn regret to say that Pompey indeed marches with the rebels to the south- worse still, it is he who holds the mantle of Dictator! It burdens my heart so to aim for victory by defeating my dear friend..." his eyes drop to a spot between his feet for a moment, but just as quickly, he triumphantly flicks his eyes to his men. "But I will do what is necessary for the Republic and for the Tribunes of the Plebs! What about you men?" He throws his arms open, preparing to be bathed in our calls of reassurance.
We rattle our shields with our swords or pilae, whooping and chanting "for the Tribunes and for our Imperator!"
"Then follow me! Glory awaits!"

<h2>III- Through the Via Salaria</h2>

No sooner than our column cleared the southern gates of the city, a series of messengers arrive all bearing similar information: the road to Rome is blocked by 31 cohorts of green troops under the leadership of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (Red-Beard) in Corfinium. The city they hold was, in Caesar's youth, the common capital of rebellious tribes, once allies for centuries. Formidable are the walls, but being the focus of Rome's ire would do damage to the city that no amount of masons could repair.

Our path takes us along the coast, with the cerulean expanse dividing me from my homeland. I strain every morning to see over the mortuary shrines lining the road, towards the east in search for any sign of a familiar coast. And every morning Subsolanus hides the Dalmatian shores under a curtain of white. Bereft of visuals, I retreat into my mind. I focus my will on memories from childhood; on the golden beams shining across near-ripe fields of crops, as I beg my father to let me accompany him to the town and on this day he assents. I remember seeing the gates choked with carts of goods and beasts of burden, all struggling to get to the market. I remember how boring waiting for my father to return from selling to the grain dole was; baking under the late summer sun for less than what slave farms make in a week.

With much sadness, I follow Caesar's lead inland. Neptune bids us farewell to the tune of crashing waves, fading to silence before the eye loses the shore. Surrounded by brown, dead earth, clouds form in my heart, conjuring thoughts of the sad days back home: the day my brother marched to war and never returned; the day that my mother died after getting ambushed by pirates in the Adriaticum; and the day that I marched off to war, leaving behind my widowed father and younger sister. The clouds darken and unleash a torrent of rain as I assess that, yes, I too will not return home. Life on the farm isn't for me anymore; those fond memories, coated in a golden glow, feel as real to me as my dreams. But at least nightmares don't plague me in the waking hours.
Three days following the Kalends of Februarius, we set up camp within sight of Domitius the red-bearded's camp. Camp? Why leave the walls and the city undefended? Even Sulla declined to attack Corfinium. Maybe he anticipates our horde to be large enough to negate the advantage of walls. Regardless of the size of the enemy gathering on the horizon, I would order my men to defend our post unto death.

Dawn broke over the horizon on the fourth day after the Kalends, blanketing the Apennine ridges in a warm orange glow. I stifle a yawn. Excitement builds in my heart as I stow my roll, for it has been short two and a half years since last my gladius were painted by blood. Though, something mumurs in the depths of my soul; the men I am to face are fellow Roman citizens. All the enemies I've fought were clearly enemies. But these men carry Aquilae, just as we do. Can a nation be saved over the blood of  one's countrymen? Nevertheless, I slide the mail armor on, following it with a billowing red cloak. I gave my word to Caesar, so on Caesar's word I shall die.
As I emerge from our tent, concerned voices carrying messages of anxiety and fear reach my ears.
"-but they outnumber us three to one! We'll be torn asunder for sure!" One of the new recruits laments.
"You needn't worry! The fear you feel now is certainly shared by all the men just up the hill from here, for they have bore the Aquila for shorter than you two!" Marcus reassures.
"Truthfully so." I add, sitting on the ground near Marcus, "Our first battle was against the Nervii in Belgica. I remember as vividly as if I stand on the field that we were nearly overrun at several points in that battle... and we were at the baggage train!" These words only seem to draw more fear into their eyes, "But, just like Marcus said, you needn't worry; we have Caesar on our side and they don't! It was Caesar's quick thinking that saved us then and it is this that will save us before this battle even begins!"
"I wouldn't say it was Caesar who saved us then. It was Labienus, in command of the Tenth, that marched straight to the Belgic camp and crushed the Nervii from behind. Caesar's plan was to hold the line until it broke and we would all lay dead on the field." Marcus coolly retorts.
"Not so! As we reached the battle lines, I saw him in the midst of a melee with the Seventh! Caesar was just as prepared to die there as we were!" I argue.
"You are correct, Publius, yet Marcus is right about Labienus saving the day. Truly a shame that he denounced Caesar and stormed from his camp once he heard of our actions, but I can't say that it isn't understandable, if not justified." Granius states, seeking to cool the embers before a fire erupts from them.
The other recruit glances between myself and Marcus, confusion emanating from him, "While the merits of both of those commanders are without question, how does reveling in the past calm my nerves in the present?"
"Because if we've seen Dis' domain and returned, then you can be sure that we'll carry you both back with us!" Junius rises to rub the heads of the recruits, "This'll go over easier than canoodling your wife on the Nones!"
They both force a smile, but the fear clings to them and refuses to release. The best that any of us old-timers can do is hold the line for them and hope they gain their sea legs soon.
A horn slices through the camp, followed by the sound of thousands of men rising to tear down the camp and advance. Forming our battle lines at the base of the hill, I notice that not a single man stands opposite us. I nudge one of the recruits behind me and point this out.
"Look," I say, "we were right. They are too scared to raise a single sword in their defense!"
This appears to calm him slightly, but there isn't much that I can do to stop the first-battle-jitters. In fact, I, myself, feel Thantos' hands slip across my chest.
Another horn sounds, ordering the advance. The ground rumbles with the footfalls of our half-strength legion, our presence augmented by our unwaivering will to see Caesar's orders through to the death or victory. Even Neptune the Earth-Shaker trembles from our advance! Yet still, the seconds drag into hours and the enemy camp stretches further and further from our grasp.
We reach the outside of missile range, with three blasts of the horn signalling a halt. Our Centurion, along with every other, fall out of formation and meet behind the lines. I barely have time to scan the surroundings for myself before they come sprinting back to their centuries. With a gesture, our Centurion calls forward our Decani to pass down specific orders. With this accomplished, he turns and leads us to our designated position. Our whole line obliques the camp, then fractures into pieces to surround it. We stop at a point in the north east of the camp, between the Sixth and First cohorts. Before our baggage train mounts the hill, half of the cohort melt into the woods to gather wood, while our half are told to begin digging in.
"I want everyone to assist in digging the trench first. Once that is done, myself and the new-bloods will construct the ramparts. I want Marcus, Junius and Publius to build the inward defenses. I trust you three will stay safe from enemy fire as you do so." Granius orders.
"Ave!" We all reply.
The sun dips under the third cohort's gate as we finish the fortifications, glinting off the sweat coating my body and clothes. I trot up the ramp to the top of the ramparts to see the lay of the field. An orangey-red (rutilus would be the word for it) hue falls over the unbroken chain of walls, coiled around the camp like a snake. From inside it, our disposition would appear quite frightening and stifling. This could be another Alesia. I think, Pompey will send his forces to relieve them by the first Nones of Februarius, without question. Which means that a contravallation will soon follow the walls I stand on. Though, at least at Alesia we had eleven other legions to fill gaps in the line.
The second sunset of the siege ended as uneventfully as the first; the enemy lurks within his own walls, not even manning their defense. A concentrated push on the gates may collapse our lines, but I have faith in the first through fourth cohorts to hold these strategic positions. Surely the enemy has noticed this as well, right? Would that be the reason that he slinks in the shadows and slips between the sun's rays in the day; trying to lure us into a false sense of complacency? If it were me in their position, I would've contested the approach and stretched Caesar's lines thin with the overlong length of the three legions at my disposal. This Lucius Domitius guy can't be all he's cracked up to be if he cowers behind his cowering men at the sight of us!

On the morning of the seventh day of the siege, the eastern gates of the camp swing open, revealing a column of men marching out with their swords raised to the sky. Men keep pouring from the gate as the vanguard passes a point halfway to our lines.
"They seem to be only massing on that side, Junius and Publius, take Gnaeus here and go reinforce the First!" Granius slaps one of the recruits on the back. Oh! He's the one that I reassured as we marched up here! So that's his name!
"Ave, Granius! Be well!" I call, racing off to the First's ranks.
"Ave!" Junius and Gnaeus salute before joining me.
"Are you alright, Gnaeus? You are shaking more than a canine bereft of a place to relieve himself!" I jest.
"I-it's really about to happen, isn't it?" He squeaks.
"What's about to happen?" Junius inquires.
"It." He states, matter-of-factly, "The killing, the dying, the bloodshed! Dis is here, I can feel it! He hungers for carrion!" His face slides to white, his eyes pop from his face like apples hanging from the branches that are his hair.
"What'd we tell you, amicus? You're with us, so if Thantos tries to snatch you from the field, we'll hunt him down and drag you back!" Junius reminds him.
"I don't know what's scarier; the mass of men down there or the fact that you two think you can overpower Pluto and bring me back like you're Hercules or something." He shakes his head, but when his head rises, a smile pulls at the corner of his lips.
"There's a good lad." Junius ruffles his hair, "Now, we've got to double-time if we're to make it before the fighting starts!"

Huffing, we reach the area designated to the First. Immediately, we search out their Centurion. Searching for a moment, we find him behind the archway of the gate speaking to the Decani of his cohort. Their faces are ashen or stoic, all being briefed about the difficulties of holding their position, no doubt. But, I'm sure that they are already more than aware of the overwhelming horde opposite the wooden gate. We favor waiting for the briefing to end before reporting to the Centurion.
Sure enough, the Centurion waves the men off to their stations and turns to face the towering ramparts in his command.
We walk over and salute, "Ave, Centurio!"
"And you men are...?" He studies us intently.
"Publius Sentius, Seventh Cohort."
"Fabius Junius, Seventh."
"Gnaeus Appius, new recruit for the Seventh."
"Ah, I see! Well met, comrades! What brings you to our cohort?" He softens his gaze, gesturing to us with open arms.
"Our Decanus, Manius Granius, sent us over to swell your lines for the fight." Junius reports.
"Gratias ago! Your Decanus would be right to send you here. For now, I'm your Centurion and Decimus over on the right of the gate will be your Decanus. Once the fighting dies down, you're free to return to your unit." He salutes us and points to Decimus.
"Ave!" We salute back and hasten to the new Decanus.
Reaching the ramparts, I tap who I think is Decimus on the shoulder. He turns and casts a wary eye over us.
"How can I help you all?" He asks.
"Your Centurion has put us under your care for the duration of the fight, sir!" I report.
"Glad to hear it! Find an open spot on the rampart and prepare to make Mars proud!" He turns back to the approaching men, furrowing his brow at the odds.
On the rampart, I grip my pila tightly, resting three others on the sticks in front of me. Raising my arm to ready a throw, I aim for somewhere in the middle of the enemy. My arm swings forward out of instinct, but- "Hold! Hold your fire!" stops me mid-throw. I lower the pila and look to see why we were stopped.
The enemy column stopped when they saw the points of our javelins bristling from every branch composing our wall. In unison, they throw their swords to the ground, lifting both hands.
"Hail Caesar!" They call, "We have come to offer our surrender!"
"Surrender?" I utter, awestruck.
"Surrender?!" Junius growls.
"Yay! Surrender!" Gnaeus cheers.
The column parts down the middle, making way for two men carrying a limp patrician. The two march along the path, reaching the gate in moments. They toss the patrician towards us, his body rolling before coming to a stop face-down. I notice the binds on his wrists and ankles, more than enough to stop him from fleeing, but not enough to stop him from thrashing once he realized where he was. Could this be L. Domitius? Are these men so new as to surrender their commander at the first sign of conflict, or did they plan this?
"We have brought our Legate, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, as hostage!" The two men announce.
The Centurion of the First calls out, "Open the gate!" Every Decanus along the line repeats the order, with our men throwing it open with a bang.
"Line up along the path!" Our temporary Decanus orders.
This having been accomplished, Caesar appears on his white horse and dismounts at the end of the lines. The two men pick Domitius up once more and stride forward, followed by ten men of their rank. The ten stop at the threshold of the gate. With a closer view, I can see that they are the most senior of the Centurions. The guard for Domitius passes me, both men appearing to be the highest ranking officers other than Domitius himself. They finally stop one sarissa length from Caesar and drop Domitius for a second time. That's gotta hurt each time they do it.
L. Domitius Ahenobarbus' perspective
I struggle against my binds, just hoping that one good pull will undo the knots tied by the rock-heads that I should be the commander of. Yet here they are, turning me over like a bag of grain to the traitor Caesar!
"No more struggling, sir, now's the time for groveling." The Camp Prefect whispers in my ear as he pulls my head off the ground by my hair.
I spit in Caesar's direction. "Grovel?!" I shout, "To him? Not in this life or with Pluto!"
I defiantly meet Caesar's eyes, trying to get an upper hand in the staring match. He looks back coldly, uncaringly and honestly like he is kind of bored. He continues on studying me, not moving a single muscle, even in his eyes. The tense moment breaks as he waves his Prefect over. Murmuring something in his ear, he points at me and then waves him off towards the nearest camp. He returns his gaze to me, staring for what seems like an eternity before his lips break into a grin.
"Lucius... Domitius... Ahenobarbus..." He laughs with glee, "Just the man I wished to see in this very position! Do those binds make you feel uncomfortable?"
I scoff, "No more than staring at you does."
He laughs again, louder, "You've still got fight in you, but your men don't! I can respect that." He looks off to where the Prefect ran off to. I strain my eyes to catch a glimpse of what's coming, but my head gets snapped back into place by "my" Prefect. The only warning I have is the growing sound of hoofbeats.
The Prefect arrives on the horse and dismounts, handing the reigns to Caesar. "Now then, we can begin!" He looks at "my" Prefect, "Release him, if you would." He drops my hair, "Good, now, Centurion, his binds." The Centurion nods and steps to my back, grabbing the rope on my wrists and wrenching it upwards. I howl in protest. To my shock, the binds fall loose and he moves to my ankles to do the same. I rise and rub my wrists to rid them of the red burns. "This horse I have in my hand is yours, should you do one thing for me."
"What would that be, oh mighty Caesar?" I reply sarcastically.
"Swear to me that you will never again raise arms against me. And, seeing as I am the Pontifex Maximus, this oath you not only swear with me, but the gods as well! Choose wisely, friend, hostage or free?"
I stare at him angrily, but finally sigh and agree. "Before all the gods and the Pontifex, I, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus second of my name, swear to not raise arms against you, Gaius Julius Caesar, for the rest of the days that I walk the mortal plane." Actually, I may.
"Very well, then! You're pardoned and this horse is yours." He meets me in the middle and passes the reins to my hand. "Safe travels, friend!" He swats my horse's backside to get it moving.
Where to next that will annoy Caesar the most?

<h2>IV- Senatus Consultum Ultimum</h2>

"First cohort! Formation in front of the Legate!" The Centurion shouts.
Some groans are loosed in reply, but all the men oblige -except for Gnaeus, Junius and myself. Upon hearing the orders, we turn and begin to march back to our section of the wall.
"You men, there! Hold fast!"
I freeze in mid-stride, staring apprehensively over my shoulder. I turn around, gesturing for Gnaeus and Junius to do the same. "Ave, Centurio!" We cautiously amble over to the back of the cohort, our eyes flicking towards anything that moves.
The Century gathers at Caesar's feet, as his guard against these potentially hostile men. Caesar raises his hand and bids us be silent.
"You men, hark! You all did make a sacred oath to serve Domitius, now I require you to make one to me! That is, unless you will swear to never take up arms against me. Be prescient of mind, ye men! For I am still the High Priest! Any oath you swear unto me has the weight of one made to Jove himself!"
A voice rises from the gathered, unarmed men, "Good Caesar, what if we wish to go in peace?"
"Then go in peace," Caesar coolly states.
Several cohorts salute and disperse from the group, some going to Corfinium, some going north through the Apennines, many others travelling south to return home. Many still stand where they were, waiting for Caesar to continue.
"I am surprised that so many of you remain!" He paused, perching his hand on his chin in thought, "but, these returns from Domitius are not to my liking. He stole 60 Sesterces from the public treasury in this city! He attempted to give it to me as bribe, but, recognizing that this was public pecunia, I sent his money away! I thought the value of one life more than the small pile of coins he pushed onto my desk, and did I not let him keep his life for free? To my shock, my scouts hath told me that this money now rides its way to Pompey! Gracious, intelligent soldiers, will you allow this menace to accept stolen money to pay for his illegal legions?"
"No, Caesar!" the crowd, and even we, reply.
"Raise thine right hands and hail me as your Legate!" Caesar shouts, the echoes of his voice covered by the men reciting the sacred oath of soldiering.
The mass of soldiers breaks up as they are sent off to various cohorts to replenish, with many forming new ones on account of the large number of new men. Before long, the orders trickle down to get back on the Via Salaria.
Within what felt like a single shift, the mighty walls of Rome rose over the horizon. A buzz of excitement hung in the air like the buzzing in an angry beehive, as we transferred avenues to the Via Labicana.  The outer walls of Rome feel familiar to me, despite this being the first time that I have walked through her streets. It's like there's something about it that makes it feel like home for people from any birthplace or walk of life, even mine which has me entering it as a conqueror -by ruling of the Senate, no longer inhabiting the eternal city. In fact, the whole city is quiet. Our voices are the only noises that echo off the walls and sing back our marching songs. The streets are bereft of the carts and rabble, missing the marching lictors and the proud Consuls, no longer holding even the average citizen on their way to or from their homes and occupation; Rome is a city of mute ghosts.
We carry on to the towering citadel perched atop the Capitoline hill, casting its long shadow over the forum beneath it. Caesar breaks off as we pass the Curia, ordering the XIII to join him. The new recruits, along with the VIII and V, ascend the Capitoline to garrison the bricked-in home for what few soldiers are normally allowed within the city limits. But now, that limited number has swelled to several legions, none of which were chosen by the Senate to live there, only on the orders of a man who views himself as above the rules of Rome. For good reason, however, since the Senate had spent years without addressing the growing number of urban poor who were driven off their family land by the conglomerates of slave-farms run by the Equites and above. Caesar's first bill was to rectify this and buy the land off the rich to give back to those farmers who lost it all, in hopes that they might bolster the waning grain production from Italia.
I follow the throngs of the XIII on the way to the Curia. The sun begins to set behind us as we amble through the marble-clad temples blocking the view of the brick-and-wood houses behind them. My gods, the city is more beautiful than I could have imagined. I was always told that the race of Latins that Rome had sprung from were the punching bags of yester-centuries, and for them to have built this upon the ashes of the Gallic occupation is impressive, to say the least. The column slows as we near the building, fanning out to encompass the perimeter and watch for any illicit persons or actions. My position is a place to the left-hand side of the entryway, as only the most trusted of Caesar would be the ones tasked with allowing the members he wished to meet into the building.
Not long after we arrive, I notice Marcus Antonius proudly striding through the door, under the raised salutes of the centurions nearby. Following him were the Tribunes we had protected, rightfully returned to the limits of Rome in accordance with the laws. Shortly after, the doors again parted to allow in a small gathering of purple-striped togas into the building, most certainly men who either supported Caesar or were indifferent to the pleas of either side. Surely more Senators are coming, right? This is a meeting called for by the Pontifex Maximus after all.
Alas, the door remained closed for the time being, allowing Caesar to raise his voice and address the men who were smart, or brave, enough to make their way over to here.
"Fine Senators," Caesar greets, "I greatly appreciate you all taking time from your nightly feasting and imbibing to listen to my humble beseeching. I ask each and every one of you gathered here to tell me what you think of an idea I had considered on the way to home today."
"Tell us, Caesar! We wish to hear!" One of the Tribunes exclaims.
"Well, here's the rub," he pauses for a moment, I assume with his hand gracing his mouth in thought, "Pompey is legally the Dictator of Rome, and since he abandoned not only the city but the treasury as well, which way would you good sirs would vote on a bill that I am considering proposing on the morrow." An odd hush falls over the men in the building and outside, wondering what it is that Caesar was getting at.
"The issue with this," Caesar continues after another moment, "is that I am unsure as to the legality of having two separately elected Dictators. Would it go about in a way that Cincinnatus' surrendering of the position went?" In what way, Caesar? "What I ask is, how many of you would vote for me to become the Dictator to fix the Republic and root out the corruption that has seeped so deeply into the wheels that turn politics, that even I couldn't escape from greasing them with illegal pecunia. All in favor?"
Several Senators affirm their votes, followed by us soldiers loosing our faith in Caesar as shouts to the heavens.
Caesar chuckles, "It appears that even my legion has agreed! To celebrate, join me in going off to the Temple of Saturn to gather the money that they so clearly deserve!"
The door swings open as Caesar struts out, the Senators and Tribunes in tow. We break off of our positions and fall in around Caesar and his entourage. Caesar leads us to a building, with several tall pillars reaching high into the sky and capped with a triangular roof, and past the statues of Saturn having a midnight snack of his small children.  Before the doorway stands a different Tribune of the Plebs. He seems to be undeterred by the approach of an entire legion and continues to block the entry to the treasury. Caesar raises his right hand, causing us to stop in our march. He steps forward to confront the Tribune.
"You, Tribune, you're from the Caecilii, correct?" Caesar inquires.
"Correct, Caesar. My name is Lucius Caecilius Metellus, and I won't let you in," he replies.
"Noble Lucius, please step away from the door and allow me, the proper Dictator of Rome, to enter and gather what I need. I will only be a moment," Caesar requests.
"That I cannot allow, Caesar. As Tribune, I have the right to veto any action that you may attempt. Take one more step and I will veto you before the Senators at your back, and reiterate when asked if they heard it!" He exclaims, stretching his arms and locking them on either side of the threshold of the door.
Caesar sighs heavily then locks eyes with Lucius, his eyes burning with anger, "Lucius, move out of the way of the door or I will call the soldiers behind me to beat you until you're dead, then chop you into pieces and cast them into the Tiber, just like the Titan who stands on either side of you!" Caesar exhales, "You have thirty seconds."
The seconds slip by like hours while we waited to see what Lucius would do. First ten seconds: he stands defiantly, his arm muscles still tensely locked on the door. Second ten: his eyes droop down as he ponders his mortality. Then, suddenly, he drops his arms and silently walks off. As he passes Caesar, he shoots him a glare that says "take more of the People of Rome's money than you need and it's your head."
"Good choice, my friend!" Caesar calls after the Tribune. "Soldiers, line up to get paid!"
We single-file follow Caesar to the doorway, where he counts a few coins and hands it to the soldier at the door. Coins clink as they're inventoried and passed out, being stuffed into bags -once the legion has received their share- for the other legions under Caesar's care. Oddly, Caesar stayed in the room after the payment money was readied, still counting coins and putting them into one big bag. What could this be for? When Caesar was speaking to the Senate, he said that he "greased the wheels" to get elected, so is this to pay for the debts he incurred to afford bribes?

<h2>V- Sulla Returned or Marius Incarnate?</h2>

Caesar brushes dirt off of his knees and shins after spending the waning hours of the evening crouched on the floor of the Temple of Saturn. His stomach growls. It’s too late to get food at one of the shops in the Forum, but as the newly elected Dictator, he surely could find someone to entertain him and provide food. Caesar ambles past the Pool of Curtius along the Via Nova, before turning southward to return to his home. He looks up at the Palatine Hill and spots Cicero’s illustrious domicile, complete with a bountiful garden, wide-reaching trees to meditate under and most definitely a library large enough to be bigger than the home that Caesar had been born into. Beyond the Palatine, Caesar could spot the packed Aventine on which he had lived as a child, surrounded by poets, philosophers and anyone else too poor to afford a place on their own. He recalls bitterly how hard he worked to acquire more money to help move his mother into a better home, and how she died before he could begin the more lucrative positions in the Cursus Honorum. Her death and funeral had been a chance for Caesar to nail the flag of the common man to his mast, waving images of his uncle, Gaius Marius, before his enemy, Sulla, had even left power. A dangerous game, to be sure, as Caesar was on Sulla’s proscription list prior to then. But Sulla, like Caesar’s enemies now, couldn’t get a grip on the slippery nature of Caesar’s person.

Caesar sighs, he couldn’t find a home with the occupants still awake and socializing. “Time to go home, it seems,” he thinks. “It’s been a few months since last I saw my wife, and I’m sure that she would be overjoyed to have me return home.”

Calpurnia sprints from an adjoining room into the atrium to greet her wayward husband. She notices that something hangs behind Caesar’s eyes, almost as if it were self-doubt, frustration or just exhaustion. She thusly comforts him with a tight hug, waving to her cooking slave to prepare a quick meal for her unusually terse husband. She leads him to one of the couches in the atrium, pushing him down onto it. He sighs in relief.
“You must be parched, dear. Let me get you some water,” Capurnia soothingly states, brushing Caesar’s cheek before walking over to the storage room, populated with amphoras of wine and water she collected from the aqueducts. She picks up a goblet and pours water in, reaching less than half the height of the receptacle, then fills the rest with the assyrian wine. Returning with the wine-heavy drink, she presses it into Caesar’s hands, which he happily drains.

Bright rays from the rising sun shine onto Caesar’s bed and invade the space on his eyelids. He opens them slowly, blocking the light to find his way out of the floor-level sleeping arrangement. Caesar motions over one his slaves to assist him in donning his toga, purple-striped for the second time in his life. He straightens the part draped over his left forearm, nodding to his slave and departing. On the way out of the front door, he grabs a piece of bread and drizzles honey over it. Digging his teeth into the stale crust, a lictor escort of men comprised from the first cohort of the XIII jog to cover Caesar’s flanks. Caesar greets his men and offers them some of his bread, despite there not being enough for everyone there.

As the Capitoline hill looms over the Forum, Caesar leans over to one his soldier-lictors, “Summon Marcus Antonius for me and tell him to meet me at the Aedes Iovis Optimi Maximi Capitolini. We have much to discuss.”

“Ave, Caesar! It shall be done!” He shouts, sprinting off to the citadel housing the soldiers.

Caesar ascends the road leading to the meeting spot, striding like a general on triumph between the palatial temples that line the heart of Rome. Once the statue of Jupiter proudly calls out its presence, Caesar spots Antonius loitering outside the doors, idly chatting to the soldier Caesar sent to get him.

Antonius approaches, “Ah, fair Caesar! May you be well, friend! What is it that clouds your mind so as to need my assistance?”

“Good morrow, Antonius. Please, accompany me inside,” Caesar smiles, clapping his hand on Antonius’ shoulder to lead him through the towering wooden doors. “My friend, for you I have a task which is suited to only your command,” Caesar’s voice echoes off the walls and rings its melody to the roof.

“I am most honored! What is the deed that need only be done by I?”

“You, my Master of Horse, must maintain the structure and stability of the Roman Republic until the day that I return victorious in my endeavors against these perfidious robbers of the common man! Do this and I will be in your debt. You will be rewarded most handsomely for a job well done, the prize for which I have yet to decide.”

“I shall do it, Caesar! Jupiter as my witness I will do right in your name!” Antonius pauses for a moment, then raises his voice again, “But one inquiry nags at the back of my soul, good sir.”


“Speak it, friend.”

“Where will you go first? Pompey still gathers men in Magna Graecia, but he can’t possibly escape from your speedy marches and cunning tactics!”

“Aye, I first will go to stop Pompey and hopefully this will cause his legions in Hispania to surrender, leaving only Africum and the isles in Optimate hands. I have already sent word to Labienus to break winter camp and march south to put pressure on the seven or so legions in Hispania. I shall accompany him in this with the fresh XVII, XVIII and XIX legions, which should be more than plenty to overcome the men that Pompey has forgotten.”

“Excellent plans, as always, Caesar! But for the policies I am to enact in my time as your plenipotentiary, which would be the most important for me to push in favor of?”

“The land redistribution bill that I had attempted to pass in my time as consul. Poor farmers need suffer no longer under the conglomerate slave farms built on land that was once their ancestral birthright! I trust you will get this done, Antonius, for the Republic is in dire need of fixing.” Caesar gestures to his entourage, “But for now, I must depart. Pompey cannot be given extra time to escape.”

“Understood. May Fortuna favor you, Caesar!”

Caesar leaves the temple and treks over to the overcrowding citadel. He calls together the legates of the V, VIII, IX, XII and XIII for a short war council meeting. The generals listen carefully as Caesar outlines his plan for catching Pompey’s meager forces in the port city of Brundisium. One of his generals informs him as to his previous consular partner’s command of the Adriatic fleet which would contest the plan he laid out. Caesar waves him off, explaining that if Bibulus were good at command, he wouldn’t have hidden in his home, nor would the wise people of Rome had covered in feces when he tried to exercise his veto on a bill that benefitted every Roman. The legates nod in agreement, retreating into their minds to best interpret their role in the up-coming short campaign. Caesar dismisses the men and walks to the south-eastern gate of the Eternal City, awaiting his forces to join him.

Shadows drag across the ground, blocking the approaching legions from the warmth of the Sun, on account of the tall walls surrounding Brundisium; doors barred shut in the deafening silence falling over the territory of Apulia. When Neptune opes his form to allow Apollo to urge on his chariot around the world again, the orange light plays across the resolute defenders’ helms, standing guard on the ramparts to prove that Pompey will not be so easily subdued. Caesar orders his legions to break up to gather wood and food, as well as build a central camp to contest Pompey’s position. With wood gathered and the camp walls erected, Caesar directs the rest of the construction materials to go towards siege engines and broad boats to carry earth and dump it in the port.

Come Apollo’s next visit above the lands of Italia, the crafts Caesar called for sail about the seas; loading the dirt and gravel onto their boats, leading the materiel to the growing breakwater originating from the shore and dodging scorpion bolts, javelins and arrows raining down from the docks. To the surprise of the mariners aboard Caesar’s vessels, Pompey sends out his own naval force; lobing flaming torches to set the decks on fire and hurling missiles to take out the construction crews. Caesarians answer in kind with rocks from the breakwater, as well as whatever missiles they had brought with them. The harassment lasted until the night again blanketed the lands in darkness. During the lull in the fight, Pompey slips his forces out of the unfinished breakwater and into the Adriatic.

Caesar awakes to see the ramparts vacant of troops. He orders his siege engines forward, thinking that Pompey has finally come to see sense and will surrender. His head erupts into flames when the centurions return to report that the entire Pompeian navy and the adjoining legions had disappeared in the early morning seamist. Caesar stops for a moment to think before lashing out at his commanders.

“Good thing he decided that now is the time to retreat, for his legions in Hispania now have to go through us to regroup with him. We could use this to our advantage.” The legates and centurions nod in agreement as Caesar continues, “You men will stay here and ensure that he believes that we are waiting for the winter months to pass before journeying across the Adriatic. In that time, I will go off and unite with the legions coming from Gaul and crush the men who wish to resist in Pompey’s land. Do well by my name, good soldiers!”

“Ave, Caesar!” The reply.

Caesar saddles his horse and rides north at a break-neck pace for other generals, but for him is a leisurely trot through the countryside. Caesar meets with his legates east of Massilia, where they inform him of something else to make his blood boil.

“Friends! My heart warms to see you all again. Wait… Where is Labienus? Is he not feeling well?” Caesar asks, the smile fading from his lips.

“About that, Caesar, we received word from Belgae that he departed camp as soon as he found out that you marched against Rome. He didn’t even gather his things, he was leading the camp in the evening and was nowhere to be seen in the morning,” the legate of the V informs him, with a voice that shook.

“Labienus, I did what I did to ensure that you would get the governorship once my tenure ended. Why desert me when I need you most?” Caesar rests his palms on the table, then sighs and speaks,

“Gather his things and cart them off to wherever he is. If he’s going to lead a good campaign, he’ll need his books and notes.”

A messenger at the back nods and sprints from the tent, “Aye, sir.”

“As distressing as this is, we still have a job to do, gentlemen. So, how many legions has Pompey in Hispania?”

“We believe it to be seven, sir. However, he dispatched two of them to go to Thither Hispaniam and put down a local uprising there. We can be reasonably confident that they will be unable to reinforce the main army,” the legate of the VI puts his finger on the two places.

“Good news. Fortuna may favor us yet. There’s no time to delay, and glory beckons!”

Caesar’s force stamps the roads into place from Genoa to Masillia, finding this of all cities to declare neutrality in the face of three hardy legions. As unaware columns near the city, Caesar’s previously pardoned member of the Optimates, Lucius Domitius, slides into the docks while night casts the Rhenum valley into dark. Assuming command of the garrison, he prepares the walls for a siege, imminent at dawn. Caesar again wakes to see a city raising the flag of the Optimate supporters, again commanded by the same man. Caesar, for his part, felt what lesser men would feel in his previous position; head bathed the color of Mars from the overwhelming desire to see the head of Domitius fall to the ground with an anti-climactic thump. But he hasn’t the time to sit and wait for a siege to end when he has to stamp out the Pompeian legions in Hispaniam! Now is the time for swift action for the cunning commander and simple work for the lower commanders, Caesar reassures himself. And so, he throws his leg over the white stallion’s flank, spurring it on towards the Pyrenees with only his bodyguards in tow.
