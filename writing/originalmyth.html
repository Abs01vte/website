<h1>The Original Myth</h1>

I point my face to the careless skies
Flinging open my jaw in defiance
Straining my lungs and diaphragm
But nothing escapes

I shove the boulder up the insurmountable hill
Until it reaches the hill's highest point
Only for it to roll back to the bottom
And demand I try again

I simmer in the earthenware cook pot
Goulash and human parts bubble
Melting my limbs, maring my face
But no one seems to care at all

I soar high above the waves on my feather and wax wings
The Sun's rays warm my skin, melt the wax
Rushing air tells me I'm dropping like a stone
But even the ocean refuses to embrace me

I slip through the cracks of the mailroom conveyor belt
One crack after another until it's just emptiness
Deeper into ignominy and self-directed self-loathing
And no one seems to notice I disappeared

I have a falling out with life and its meanings
Staring at its empty words, its valueless hopes
All meaning it once contained has been lifted
And leaves me without a plate, without knowing it was empty all along

Grey stone, carved with my name and birthdate
Jumps at me from the shadows
Knocks me over the head
And slips me under the surface of the Earth

Six feet below
Eight feet long
Four feet wide
Pine to constrict me

One ton of dirt
Not a single tear or well-wisher
Uncaring undertakers fling the soil
Up and into my new home

My halo?
The rope looping around my neck
My release?
The short drop and sudden stop
My last words?
No one listened
My last wishes?
No one to bequeath to
My last meal?
The dirt I'm covered in
My last smile?
Funhouse mirror frowns
My final resting place?
Not even I know.
