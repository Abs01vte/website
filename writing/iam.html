<h2>I Am</h2>
I'm the seeds you've sown when it's time to reap
I'm the box of tissues when it's your turn to weep
I'm the destruction that your apathy has wrought
I'm the sea of debt that your greed has bought

I'm the policeman, the coroner and the killer
I'm the hurricane when you want it stiller
I'm the thorn in your side when you try to roost
I'm the incubus your godlessness has seduced 

I'm the seed, the stem, the leaf and the poison
I'm the snake in the tree whispering, "sin"
I'm the goat you send off into the woods
I'm the lowlands when the whole world floods

I am your sink without a drain 
I am the voice at the back of your brain
I am the one shouting "stand and fight back"
I am the one who is calling for attack 

I am the one who will break you to pieces
I am the fine print in all of your leases
I am fate, in the purest sentimentality
I am the harbinger of evil's totality 

I am the inverted cross, the horns and the grin
I am the darkness we all have within 
I am Satan, the germination of isolation
I am the reason why you pray for absolution
