<h1>Sink, Sank, Sunk</h1>

Bobbing on the sea of suffering
My ship contends with the waves
Breaking them over the bow
Splashing their essence on the decks
Until there is no distinguishing between
What is mine and what is the sea

A lighthouse, normally illuminating
Everything around it in warnings,
Now sits in mute disregard
For mariners' safe passages
And without her light
My ship beaches on rocky shores

Rocking back off the land
It tries to continue sailing
Effort exerted in vain
For the hole below the prow
Pulls the deck under the waves
And drags me down with it

How can I be a mariner with no ship?
How can I kick my way to the surface
With no intention of living beyond?
How can I let myself drown in the black,
Inky, turbulent seas without a fight?
How can I make myself go on?

Errant bubbles reflect moonlight
On their way to the surface
Yet another deserter from me
Even my ship leaves neither debris
Nor its form anywhere in my sight;
Just me and Mother Ocean

Back into her womb, I'm drawn
Back into her depths, I sink
Deeper into wretched isolation
Deeper into solitary confinement
Further from what I consider my home
Further from what I consider normal

Until the last of my breath is extinguished
Until the last of my strength is sapped
Until the last of my life evaporates
Until the last of my hope drains away
Until the last of my happiness feels like sadness
Until all that divides me from death
Is a coroner's report
