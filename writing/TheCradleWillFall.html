<h1 title="item1">The Cradle Will Fall</h1>

<h3 title="item3">I- Pendulum </h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>In ages past, our land was ruled by two factions, locked in a bitter battle to have two rulerships in a row; eternally caught in the pendulum swing. That is, until the day that the string snapped. It is told that one of our ancestors tried to hold the power for himself and for his kin- rather than for the good of the people that elected him. From this, a most vicious uprising tore down his ivory castle; dooming him, his family, his supporters and anyone who dared vouch for him to waste bags lining the sidewalks of every street with their blood coating the asphalt in red. And so those who considered their hearts to force blue blood went county to county, assimilating new-comers to their banners and exterminating any whom defy.
</p>
<p>So long was the nation broiled in turmoil, that the nations they had once swore to protect broke out into civil strife of their own- namely funded by rival nations to ours. With the threat of hostile nations to the south, the “Bastion of Freedom and Free Will” manifest-destiny-d right down to the Panama Canal; where they were stopped by the combined arms of Russo-Chinese fighters and tanks. After waves of infantry were broken on the shores of northern South America, the North American People’s Republic managed to crack the codes to the nuclear arms and mercilessly unleashed them upon the enemies- but not without sustaining hits herself.
</p>
<p>Los Angeles, Boston, New York, air, land and sea bases across the US and the administrative centers in Washington D.C. were caught in the crossfire, the nuclear defense systems unable to counter the volume of missiles targeting those strategic areas. Such was the devastation and radiation, that those areas are still impassable to this day. Even with the top-of-the-line radiation suits from oligopolies that survived the war, you’d succumb to radiation sickness before you see the signs dictating city limits. </p>
<p>Our “great” nation survived. Albeit, with a conjoined-twin amalgamation of what the two parties once were. A dreadful sight to see. And I did see it! I fought in the Socialist Uprising of 2084 and in the Wars of the League of the Workers Union back in 2090. All we did was tear the US up into small pieces. And for it, I lost my leg. It was… oh… 2091. Ah, yes, that’s right. I was minesweeping for the tanks in our company just outside the infamous battle site of Bull Run Creek, and my mine detector boom missed the mine, but my leg didn’t. Terrible pain, that. At least the army was polite enough to supply me with a mechanical replacement. Can’t imagine the price that the Privitize camp would’ve pushed onto my bill for getting an equal- or lesser- treatment.
</p>
<p>When our red-bannered ranks were sent packing at Harper’s Ferry, Columbus and Fort Wayne, I just left. Caught a boat heading to the DMZ area between the European Union and the Neo Red Guard. I think these areas were once subjects of the Soviets, and I assume that’s why NATO made it a DMZ. Whatever, though. Free land to settle in.
</p>
<p>The DMZ- colloquially, and henceforth, known as the Autonomous Zone or AZ- is mainly composed of people, like myself, who have fled the heavy hammer of either world faction, rejects from either side or natives. Since not many share a language, nationality or cultural identity, sharing a currency is difficult. Exchanging goods is usually just that, a straight trade; often without either party sharing a word. And, being either hardline opposed or a victim of authoritarian policies, each member carries some sort of weapon on them at all times. Many are shooter-aces who honed their skill by first hunting game, then humans, then back to game. I don’t dare try to hassle anyone, lest a bullet find itself lodged in my aorta. But once you get used to the idea that everyone can kill you, yet no one does if you just keep things open and on top of the table, it is no different than walking into the supermarkets of old- or so I’ve been told.
</p>
<h3 title="item1">II- Bushes Reflecting Light</h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>Peace can never last and always gives way to war, ere it has been, ere shall it be. </p>
<p>I’m thrown awake in my sleep, my diary knocked off my stomach and thunking on the floor. I take a cautious peek outside my window, seeing the first rays of daylight bouncing and playing in the clouds overhead, and yet not seeing much else. Then, the thing that woke me up starts again. Gunfire. Explosions. The low-pitched growl and hiss of a Panzer Battalion. I swipe my modified AK74 from behind my dresser, clacking the nearby mag into place. Throwing open my closet door, I grab my tac vest -conveniently pre-filled with magazines- and shuffle out of my room and into the main house below. I tap the home alarm system, eliciting the stamping and pounding of the rest of my housemates. Out into the foyer they tumble, adorned in their own styled gear.
</p>
<p>“Alright, it seems someone doesn’t understand the concept of ‘demilitarized’, so we have to go protect our livelihoods,” I inform them, my voice barely carrying over the ambient sounds of death and destruction. </p>
<p>“So, just kill them?” The ex-Privitizer inquires.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, I harbor no resentment towards the people who served under enemy banners, so long as they don’t try to make me work their way. This Privitizer doesn’t, so we can live together fine.</p>
<p>“More or less, it seems,” the Black Panther supporter replies. </p>
<p>“Let’s not dilly-dally,” I start, as a shell lands on our front porch, blowing out the door. </p>
<p>I dash out the back door and onto our vegetable and fruit garden, zipping over to the barn to get an unobstructed view on the road adjoining the house. Black smoke curls and floats like fog, following the torn-up ground tracked by the tanks. Tracks lead to where it is, idling in front of our house and aiming at our neighbors putting up a defense with RPGs and Recoilless Rifles. I slip into the barn, unnoticed, ascend the ladder to the firing hole I had pre-installed. Next to it, my drawer of goodies! One of which I need right now! Oh, what was that one quote that my grandfather would recite when he found one of his tools…? Something like… “Meeska mouska, mouska tools.” Anyways, “Meeska mouska, mouska tools,” it’s a rifle grenade! I press the mag release lever and slip the mag into my vest, clearing the action to load a single blank round. I slide the mount over the end of my barrel, attach the grenade and ever-so-carefully sneak it into the dawnlight. With a resetting of my stance, I stare down the tank opposite me. It’s a Z84 “Back-Breaker”, no less! I fought with these! I zoom my scope in until I can see the vent that can reach the ammo rack. Ah shit, it’s turned the way that would pass through to the other vent. </p>
<p>Clicking my radio to life, I say, “Heya, guys, can you maybe bring the tank’s attention your way… pretty please?”</p>
<p>The response: “No fucking way.” </p>
<p>“Aw, come on! I need you to so I can pop it!”</p>
<p>“You better not miss.”</p>
<p>“I won’t!” I tap the power button and the light-up screen ceases to illuminate. </p>
<p>My housemates fire at the tank with small arms, forcing it to turn its turret so the machine gunner can answer. Just as they’ve turned to a 45 degree angle to me, I squeeze the trigger, the grenade popping off the end and careening down into the vent. Flames pour out of the busted vents, the top hatches and the engine ventilation plates. Not a single crewman crawls out. Better that they didn’t, I would rather not see charred, living corpses. I crouch down next to my tool box and rifle through to find more of those, in case we come across other tanks. Which we’re likely to do, considering that we just took one out. The owners of that tank would surely love to make the person who did it have a good, long talk with the Reaper. I slip the thin cylinders into my vest, the bulbs presented like peacock feathers around my back. Out from the barn I run down to the cattle pasture on the north side of our allotted space. There, I find my housemates in defensive positions. Facing westward. </p>
<p></p>
<p>“What’s with the defenses towards the west?” I ask, “Didn’t we practice for the split defense?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but the enemies are only coming from the west, so…” Black Panther reflects back to me.</p>
<p>“I zink ve should link up viz ze neighbors,” the Russian sums up.</p>
<p>“Good plan.”</p>
<p>At the intersection two houses down, the locals are already gathered to discuss defense. Lucky for them that the Z84 was no longer staring down that street. Russki steps forward to interpret for us. After a short debate amongst the speaking crowd, he returns to us.</p>
<p>“Zey say zat ze enemies have broken zrough ze vestern gates. Ve are to join ze defenz around ze salient zat created, and try to encircle it.” He looks at me in particular, “And zey vant you to not completely destroy ze tanks. Zey vant zem for reuse or somezing.” </p>
<p>“We can’t just make the tank crew leave their tanks without first damaging them in some way. How else are we supposed to defeat them?”</p>
<p>“Ven ve fought ze Americans and Europeans in ze var, ve cut off zeir gas supplies, so ze tankers had to leave. Zis is ze vay zat ze locals vant to go.” </p>
<p>“If that’s our coordinated defense plan, then so be it.” I raise my hand and shout, “Let’s go acquire some tanks!”</p>
<p>“Hoorah!” The reply from our party.</p>

Two days after the first assault-
We’ve begun the march to the old city of Vilnius. Our numbers have swelled at least 20,000 strong by the time we reached Minsk, following the old highways built during the time of the original sinners.
Seven days after the assault-
The desecrated suburbs of Vilnius are in sight, along with about two divisions worth of army encampments bearing the sigils of at least four different nations. We have less than three divisions, so this could be a chance for great victory or great defeat.

“Halt, who are you and who are you with?” A security guard for the AZ encampment inquires of our platoon.

“Men with Sharp, sir,” Panther replies.

“Sharp?” He flips through his papers and finds my name, “As in ‘Sharp Pain, Sudden Drop’?”

“That’s me,” I answer, “earned that monicker in the Battle of Charleston! Bagged 100 confirmed kills just in that week-long siege.”

“I remember hearing about you. I was with the 102nd in Fort Sumter. Not sure why they chose that old relic of fort for their command centre… But ah well, it made for an easy siege. Good to see another Red Brother here in defense of freedom.”

“Likewise, Brother. Did you fight at Bull Run?”

“My unit was in reserve, we heard all the commotion and retreated with the main force when they started spilling southward. I was on the front at Harper’s Ferry and Columbus. Just left after that and came here.”

“I fought at those and Fort Wayne before joining you in falling away. Couldn’t bear to be rounded up and executed like the Red Boys of the Civil Unrest of 2035.” I trail off before springing back with one thought: “Let’s redeem ourselves for our failures in the past, here on these grounds and against those allies that killed our Brothers back then!”

“We shall, Brother,” he says, grasping my forearm in an antiquated gesture. I return the favor. “The counterattack begins at dawn. Rest well, there’s a pallet of vodka in Mess.”

“Spasibo, tovarisch,” I nod and walk through the entrance, my platoon following suit.

At 0430, my cot was thrust upwards at an angle, spilling me onto the ground. Clasping my head where it impacted the floor, I look at all my comrades doing the same as me; fumbling for what they need to get to beating back the invaders. Donning my uniform and accessories like I normally do, I strut out of the tent and into the formation staging area for my unit. Within five minutes, the rest appear and we begin to mount our chosen vehicles to reach the assault ground. My platoon fills into homemade APC that looks suspiciously like a Sonderkraftfahrzeug 257, the engine rumbling and spurting as the half-track churns soil into paste. I pop out of the commander cupola, aligning my binoculars from my carry string to look out onto the fortifications made by the enemy.

A main-line trench zig-zags along the flat terrain of the area, broken apart by firing trenches and communication trenches leading to the artillery firing positions. Our area seems to only be covered by three 105mm pieces, with potential cover from the star positions to its northeast and southwest. I’d estimate that one piece from each could reach our flanks, with one being the same potential indirect fire as the three in our sector. I rest my binoculars against my chest again, withdrawing my thermal imaging scope. After a quick scan, I sight four platoons actively defending the fortifications, with the potential for three others in reserve. However, those three are likely to have been the ones that served as night-guards, and are thus going to have less effective combat ability than their prepared counterparts.

We reach our covered dismount position. I inform my comrades of my observations on approach.

“As part of our plans, we’ll have two platoons arriving to our left flank in,” I look at my watch, “about half an hour. With another arriving to our right at the same time. Knowing this, I figure that our best plan would be to draw as much fire as we can, in order to force the enemy to bunch up in the middle to better focus on us. At this point, I’ll call our arty onto the location they all fill and hopefully break through a good portion of their manpower. With those frontline troops lacking, they’ll draw up their exhausted compatriots and then they’ll be easily moped up by our reinforcements. Any questions or objections?”

“Not a one, Sharp, sir,” a new addition to our party, to fill out our platoon, states.

“Aye,” the echo of reply.

“Then, let’s do it.”

I shoot up and extend my bipod to rest it atop the edge of our crater. My shoulder bounces as the bolt hits the spring in my buttstock. White beams of light streak out, one every five chamber revolutions, to better orient my shooting. Snapping from bullets around my ears, answering the calls of the flashes along the line, are vain attempts to wound my person. With covering fire established, my comrades fan out and occupy further craters and provide additional cover for more to advance. It’s at this moment that the artillery roars to life. Black smoke fills the space above the trenches and I can barely scream, “Down!”, before the shells find their marks. Seven explosions light up the field before my view, blasting dirt and scrap metal up, out, away and all around. I crank my sight view and open fire upon the arty crews. Not the best idea, mind you, but just the one I think of. After a few seconds, I silence one crew and redirect my fire back to the massing soldiers opposite us. Perfect.

I drop down into the crater and type out the coordinates of the infantry glob I just witnessed into the fire-control remote. I stand back into my gun, the opening salvo from our big guns beginning as I too unload my belt-canister into them. Just as I expected, less and less heads peek to fire against us. I take this time to harass more arty crews and hopefully leave just the remnants of the enemy to our reinforcements meant to arrive in… five minutes ago? I hit my radio call button and yell, “Where the fuck are our reinforcements?” until finally some radio tech replies, “Patching you through to the general.”

“General Posephus here,” the radio voices.
“General, our forces can’t get through our position without the reinforcements that you promised us. Where the fuck are they?”
“Currently deployed to positions Bravo 5 and Echo Zulu.”
“Wait, what the fuck do you mean ‘currently deployed’? They were promised to us!”
“We’ve had problems breaking through on other fronts, so we had to commit them elsewhere. They’ll arrive when they break through the city and flank the ones you fight.”
This bitch…
“Listen here, we’re outnumbered 7-1 and if we don’t get extra help here, there won’t be anything left to meet you on the other side. I’m begging you, please help.”
“I’ll see what I can do. General Posephus out.”

“Fine, then.” I turn my radio completely off and slip into the driver’s seat of the APC.

I move it into gear and begin driving to the positions I remember my crew having, screaming, “Sound off!” I find less than I’d hope for. A mere 9 of 20.

Ruskie asks, “vy are you leaving our positions?”
To which I reply, “Getting our reinforcements.”
“Zis is treason.”
“The general refused his promise, if he didn’t commit treason there, then I’m not here.”
“Vatever.”

I circle around the siegeworks, finding a few suitable spots to drop the reinforcements I’m only partially stealing. When I reach the position one of our platoons is at, I’m stopped.



























IV- The Great Double Envelopment II

“What’s the capital of Slovakia?!” The challenge.

“How should I know?” My rebuttal.

“Bratislava!” He hands out the answer.

"Just a warning, maybe don't give out the challenge answer," I state, stepping out of the APC and presenting my ID.

"Duly noted." He grabs my ID and reads it carefully. "Here you are, Sharp, sir. What business have you with our quadrant?"

"Gen. Posephus reneged his agreement to reinforcements, so I'm here to make those debts come due." I look around, "Where's the 22nd and 35th?"

"Currently engaged."

"Any other reserves?"

"Just the 13th."

"Then direct me to them."

"Right away, sir."

He opens a gate into the staging ground and indicates a tent that still has lights on. I nod and walk over to it, throwing the flaps open and announcing, "On your feet!"

30 or so men pop out of their seats, almost comically clumsy, and salute. Some even salute with the wrong hand.

"Alright, boys, I know you've been enjoying some vodka and explosion-listening, but now you've gotta join up with some real fighting! Outside, I have an APC that will take you to a point that I located in order to aid not only my company, but the whole of our army. All you need do is push through the sides until we can split them into fours. From there, it's as simple as walking through the garden."

They file out and into the back of my APC, now overweight with the amount of bodies inside. Atop the driver's cab, a soldier watches from a squatted position in order to provide covering fire. As we approach the spot I noticed, I tap the brakes twice to alert the men that we're stopping. But not just yet. I slam the gas down to the floor, pushing the half-tracked car to nearly 70 before we hit the retaining wall on the fire side of the enemy trenches, launching the car into the air and over the defenders. Goddamn, I love what Russians do with old vehicles. Within a moment, the whole of our force reaches the city centre and dismounts, spreading out to kill anyone who doesn't wear the same uniform. Or civilians. Don't wanna cause an international crisis here- well, other than the one already occurring.

I, myself, break off to attack the artillery positions and the communication trenches that line the rear of the ground my men are assaulting. At least, I hope they are. When only nine of 25 survive, I figure that the rest either retreat or die. But, these men are the people that I trained with in order to better fight the war we saw coming and are currently warring. With hope finding rocky shores in my heart, I jog down a rubble-strewn alley in the direction of my goal. All around, all I hear is the sound of death. The sounds of thousands of men seeking nothing but the destruction of the other. Such a fight leaves the soul wanting; wanting for the times where it could be without the aura of hate that hangs over the battlefield. Nevertheless, my soles brave their own trail through what once was the capital of the AZ and into a concrete clearing that bears the scars of hundreds of broken walls that once held roofs. I drop to a knee, then to my stomach, and position the butt of my rifle into my shoulder. With my left eye gazing down my binocular and my right sighting the weapon, I track the splattered dungarees scampering around the 105mms. Closing my left eye, I squeeze off round after round; dropping bodies carrying rounds and losing them, nose-first, to the soil; slumping fire control operators in their seats; targeting and eliminating commission officers and their three-stripe counterparts.

Rising from my spot, I sprint off towards the chaos I had just unleashed and engage remnants that wish to protest my approach, despite the lack of overall command or even cover. From the vantage point of the soft, rolling hill that holds the silent artillery pieces, I see but four moving figures in the area my platoon was to be operating. Four. My mind can barely grasp the number. Like worn down teeth on gears, spinning but ultimately unable to function, my subconscious takes over to fill the gaps left by my brain. Subconscious don’t like friend-killers. Rage warming my shock-chilled limbs, my hands move on their own to put crisp, clean, tumbling, breaking holes in unsuspecting backs and chests. Pink mist sprays from the exit wounds of the people I end, with nary a remorseful thought crossing in my mind’s eye.

	Upon reaching the firing trenches and crawling over the cold, blood-stained corpses underfoot, I withdraw my AZ flag and display it the place of the enemies’. With a worry-stricken voice, I call, “Sharp’s men, to me!” Three figures pop up and sprint over, composed of Pather, Ruskie and one of the new boys.

	A whole street… wiped out. A whole sub-community… destroyed by the metal projectiles of a controlled explosion. A whole set of people whose humanity could’ve shone for years to come, mercilessly put to end.

	“Anyone wounded?” I inquire of my remaining men.

“Not that I recall.”

“Repeating last.”

“Ozer zan ze nick I got on my calf, I’m unharmed.”

“Good to hear, gents. While we’re in a good-news-having mood, we’re clear up to the western portion of the city as far as I can remember. That is, assuming the reserves I scrounged up did their job. We’ll see on that last part.”

I wave to our motley quatro, bringing my legs to a run and leading the way through the spaces between piles of crumbled stone. As the sounds of fighting grow over the graveyard of civilization, something like twelve sets of footsteps break the monotony of the gunfire. We frantically swing our muzzles around us, expecting the worst. And you know what? Of all things, the worst did appear; nothing but NATO uniforms in an unbroken circle around us, commanding us to surrender. With no other options but death or life, we surrender.









V- Hanoi Hilton

Cold shackles constrict my wrists to a chain connecting our gang. A bag slipped over my head blots out the world from my vision. We're trotted off to a spot, forced to sit and wait. Then, the deep rumbling of an aircraft engine piques my ears. After a circle, the engines scream out in reverse; wheels burning and spraying their acrid smoke into the air. Arms fill the gaps in my armpits, pulling me to my feet. A muzzle brake in my lower back compels me to start marching. Where? To the plane, I guess. Up a metal staircase, and into a tight-echo-y room. Taut fabric holds my rear off the frame of a seat I'm pushed into. Hours slip by without a word from our captors- and certainly none for us, considering that Ruskie got a butt to the solar plexus as retribution for asking for a glass of water. Finally, a large bump and hard braking alert me to our arrival. Another muzzle prods my kidney, popping me to my feet to exit the plane. Into a car we go, however only myself and Panther. Where Ruskie and the kid went, I don't know. I feel a strong conviction to inquire as to their whereabouts, but I don't want to get shot.

At long last, the bag is removed from my head and I gaze upon a concrete cube with barred windows. Prison. I'm given my new identity: Prisoner 00247392. Just like that, I go from a bloodied warrior and sniper to a simple convict. And just like that, my rights as a US citizen fall away in snow flakes. The lock to my cell door rattles, swinging open to show me four men with masks to obscure their identity. Cracking batons in the palms of their hands, they close in like vultures around me. I scoot back to the wall, curled into a ball to better protect my vitals. Three trade shots on my legs and arms, draining all strength they had. I slump onto the veneered concrete underfoot, unable to cover my abdomen any longer. Sure enough, several sets of steel-toed boots find their way into my solar plexus; kick after kick leaving me breathless and gasping. When I feel I’m about to pass out, I’m pulled up by my hair and dragged into the center of a room; where a chair is roughly inserted beneath me. The door opens again and a three-star uniform enters the room.

“I’m sure you already realize why you’re here,” he states, poison seething out of his forked tongue.

“I reckon I don’t.”

“I reckon you do,” he grabs a briefcase stashed outside the cell door, withdrawing a moderately thick manila folder. Opening to the first enclosed document, he begins, “Were you or were you not volunteering as part of the so-called Red Boys of the Socialist Uprising of 2084?”

“I’m sorry, but I don’t see the Neolib war criminals in this prison.”

“That isn’t what we’re talking about.” He flips the page, “What about the Wars of the League of the Workers Union  in the 2090’s? It says here that you had 238 confirmed kills in the first two years of the war! Impressive. So, what say you? Care to deny you fought there?”

“I don’t deny my involvement in that. However-”

“Great, two for two on confessions!” He high-fives one of the lackeys.

“You know, you didn’t have to beat the tar out of me to get me to say that. I did what I believed was right then, and I’m proud of that.”

“Whatever. Alright, say goodnight, boys,” he walks out and does a cheeky wave behind him as the threshold obscures his person. By command, three fists hand-deliver their farewells.

A week after arriving, and with nightly “visitations” from the general’s lackeys, I’m finally taken from the cell; given a shower, clean clothes and a car ride to meet with someone. Who, they never said. I can only assume that it’s an attorney. Oh, well. I’m fortunate to not be blindfolded as the car snakes through the Maryland side of DC. My body is shoved against the car seat in front of me as the black sedan suddenly comes to a stop; an open door and an urgent shove ushering my knees and face onto concrete parking pavement. Two sets of hands withdraw my crumpled figure from the ground, slipping the blindfold off my eyes, revealing a concrete multi-level parking structure. From the open slits in the walls, I can see the Potomac in the distance, slowly gurgling into the Chesapeake, but cannot determine its heading as the sun sits atop its zenith; with no allowance to sight east and west. An elbow locks itself on my left arm, a gun barrel lightly resting against my left kidney. A single tug: the order to move. I comply, being led down the elevator to the ground floor and out into a street lined with brick office buildings. As I go, I notice that the architectural style hardly changes, with few notable exceptions. Right up until a courthouse with a statue of Abraham Lincoln and columns in the Greek style juts out from behind the corner of yet another office building.

My attorney spends most of our prep time writing his opening statement- which I know to be not for a few weeks- instead of submitting evidence or testimonies to help my case. With only 15 minutes until our counsel session is up, he begins to ask me simple questions: name, date and location of birth, social security number, Socialist registry number and a recorded verbal confirmation that I did, in fact, commit treason against the Federal Government. With all this acquired, he waves me off. Two MPs approach me as I exit the room and escort me down to the basement, through a tunnel and into a cell whose lock thunks as if it was originally installed in the 1800s. Fading footsteps of the guards allows me a second to test the pin tumbler of the lock. A few presses with a thin aluminum wire I found tells me that it has three pins, which is very good for me, but that the bolt wouldn’t move slowly enough for me to make a quiet escape; it’s likely rusted for that purpose. Leaving me no choice but to stay and await the deposition.
































VI- Arraignment and Sentencing

“All rise!” Seats clatter as people stand up, “The United States Military Tribunal is now in session. The Honorable Judge Maypole is presiding.”
“Be seated,” Judge Maypole issues the command with a twinge of boredom.

I uncomfortably force myself into a wood and leather padded chair, my handcuffs only feeling comfortable when I stick my hands through the lumbar hole in the back. Voices drone around me while I study the artificial wood texturing on the table before me; parts of it obscured by the papers of my lawyer. After what feels like minutes, my lawyer taps my shoulder and I awkwardly rise to my feet. The Judge says something about recess- but I don’t think they mean the kind from elementary school. Two officers take the liberty of escorting me out of the courtroom as all the viewers, amongst whom are the media tapers and personalities, pour through the entryway. I’m taken to the room I first met the Public Defender in. With an ID check and brief inspection out of the way, he opens the door to join me. And for the first time in I think a month of being acquainted with him, he spoke to me for real.

“They kind of got us hogtied and under the barrel while in a barrel. Well, you’ve had a good life, kid, at least I’d hope so. You got to kill some feds, eh? Don’t we all want to let loose like in that game GTA IX?” He kicks his feet up on the table and lights a cigarette, “Want one?” He gestures the pack to me, and I try to reach, but my handcuffs rattle in reply. “Shame. Here,” he lights it and places it in my mouth. Eww… cigarette backwash.
From around the cigarette, I say, “How did you plead for me?”
“Guilty, of course. Complying with the Prosecution’s accusations always results in a lighter sentence. Except when it doesn’t. But that’s neither here nor there. You remember the Rosenbaums- the-the… Rose-blooms? Rosenbergs! Yeah, those people from the big communist scare way back when.” He cups his ears and mimics being electroshocked, “Just like that. The only difference being, you’ve got the honor of being executed by the military.”
Ash falls to the table as I begin to reply, “How can I live through this?”
He rubs the back of his neck, averts his gaze and putts around with his mouth and lips. Not exactly the best sign.
	“Look, kid, I gotta give it to ya, you’ve got spunk and ambition. Way more than I’ve had in my days. I mean, would you believe it, all 300 of my cases were plea bargains?” I open my mouth to speak and he cuts me off, “Alright, don’t go hurting my feelings now. Defending people that Mr. Kangaroo declares to be guilty is not an easy task to do! Sometimes you’ve gotta cut your losses and try to limit the amount of years your client is in jail for.”

A knock at the door with a baton, and the call, “Five minutes!”
“Well, that’s my cue to get leaving. Do you need to use the Little Traitor’s room?”
“I do need to ventilate my spleen,” I say and add under my breath, “over your corpse though.”
He already has his head out of the door and is knee deep in a conversation about the “inalienable right” to use the john. I never did get a potty pass.

The meat of the case was conducted without my presence. Seems they already had all the evidence they needed. While the court cellroom TVs played 20th century court movies, I was awestruck by the notion that even in court martial cases, the defendant had the right to speak in their defense in the archaic court formality of what was called, “Cross-examination”. Such novel ideas of the defendant being assumed guilty rather than needing to be proven so, would almost certainly be counteracted by the antiquated idea and practice of allowing them to explain their reasonings, circumstances and unheard information that would turn the Prosecution’s case onto its head. So naturally, they got rid of it all together when Frankenstein unleashed the power of thunderstorms upon the carrion form of our nation. Better the guilty not have the chance to weasel out of their fate, the Resurrectors must’ve said, than an innocent man be put behind bars.

“And now for the Defense’s closing statements,” the Judge prompts.
“Your Honor, I-” my lawyer starts.
“Sit down,” I order, standing up and feeling the gaze of hundred or so surprised eyes, “I invoke the right of Habeas Corpus!” A few gasps cut the silence that follows.
“The right of what? We don’t have that in our list of rights,” the Judge counters.
“Your Honor, with all due respect,” I hiss, “this is part of the legislature that was around during the time that I- supposedly,” a quick nod to my lawyer, “commited the crimes levelled against me. In my best judgement and seeing that the law of the day when these crimes were to have taken place has this in its rules, would it not be so far as to reason that since it is those laws that I would have broken, that I be charged against and given the rights guaranteed under those laws?”
The Judge leans over and confers with a suit leaning against the wall behind her. With their dramatic tension raised, they turn back to the microphone and say those damned, godsend words, “I’ll allow it.”
I close my eyes and take a short breath, picturing in my mind the goal I seek from what I am to say and it emboldens me into speech, “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I do so humbly ask you to postpone your preordained judgement long enough to hear what I have to say.” Their eyes tell me that their ears are ready, “I’ll start with a simple question: would you defend your home, family and ideal of justice if you saw it in the throes of destruction?” They murmur incessantly, “Would you take up arms when your friends were mercilessly slaughtered? Would you put the world beneath your feet and scream ‘NO’ to all those who say that they were right to have killed them? Would you pull that trigger for murder when a barrel was pointed at you?
I’ll answer it for you: if you hesitated during any of those questions, you died before you could answer. If your answer was no to any of those questions, you’re dead as well. And hell, if you said yes to any, chances are you’re dead too! I said yes to all those and lived. I said yes to all those not once, but twice and lived. And if you think that I am putting on a show up here to try and convince you guys that I’m some MacGyver or something, I’m not. There are others in this room who said yes to all those not-once-but-twice and lived, others still who fought under banners I never even encountered. And, you know? What’s the difference between all of us when you boil it down, cut it apart and dry it out? That our local regiment was from a different place? That our ideals for what was right were different? Insignificant. What I did was no different from any one who sits behind me snickering as the Prosecution scrapes the hide off the leather of my case, and certainly no more deserving of praise or retribution for those deeds.
You wanna know the difference? I’ll tell you: they won. To the victor go the spoils and to the victorious pen go the ‘truths’. Look deep into yourselves and ask: is what I did wrong? Sure, killing is wrong, but I’m not the only murderer in here. Yet I’m the only one bound in chains, presented like some animal in a circus to perform tricks and hope for a treat. And do you think that they should be given the same treatment as me? Chances are, you wouldn’t. I stole glances from my Public Defender’s papers that showed that all of you are employed by the Neo-Federal Government. So obviously you’re biased. But don’t forget: you’re also the representatives of the Will of the People to dish out justice and strike down injustice. It doesn’t matter how diluted the trust in this practice of law, you have a primary obligation to the citizens of your country, to which I am a citizen as well.
Take what I said into consideration, my life literally hangs in the balance.” I retake my seat and again stare at the table before me.

“Well, then. Will the Jury please step into the Deliberation Room?” Judge Maypole sums up.
“Actually, Your Honor, I’ve decided to make my vote Conscientious Acquittal no matter what the others vote,” Juror Number 11 states with a hint of disgust.
The silence is deafening in the wake of this occurrence. Two unprecedented court proceedings in what was supposed to an open-and-shut case, this can’t be a coincidence, they must be thinking. Me? I can’t hide the grin of a madman given a tank of gasoline and a zippo. The fabled “Jury Nullification” casually mentioned in one of the movies during my temporary incarceration rearing its wonderfully ugly head. There’s no higher court than this, my lawyer keeps reciting as he froths at the mouth, nothing but the defunct Supreme Court. There’s no way they can put me down for “Public-safety Termination”. I’m not free, but I’m not on Death Row. Can’t complain; three squares and four walls to smear feces on.
