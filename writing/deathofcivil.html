<h3>Death of Civil</h3>

Light trickles through the curtains
Approaching the spot upon which I lay
Tracing lines to me and away again
Without a single motion's energy I pay

Live, die, kill, survive
Fight, win, steal, take
All these the morality around
And all these sins to my ears

Monopolize, jeopardize
Accumulate as much wealth as possible
Detract, destroy
Extract as much human essence as possible

All for the gain of the one who is atop
All for the glory of the eternal rulers
All for the detriment of the lowers
All for the pecuniary mining of all

And with all this echoing into my room
I still stay where I was when it all began
For it all shall come again and soon
And thus, why should I care and do what I can?
