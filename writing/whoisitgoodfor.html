<h2>Who Is It Good For?</h2>
Oh, Jove, that I might be freed from the sights before me. The morning dew steams off the viscera under swarms of flies; so deep has the stench penetrated my skin that the coffin flies sink their teeth into me. Not even the Muses could sing a song of glory for the humanity trampled underfoot. Oh, green fields, so coated with blood that not even rain could sink into the loam. 

Cruel, the taste on my tongue; bitter in the ashy char of betrayal. It bubbles from my gut; the sickening, black bile. The strong arbor at my back shrinks against the growing distance of the grove. Sundrops paint the gaps of leaves yellow, reflecting off the scattered metal and coagulated red. I press against the hole in my gut to find my hand smeared with dried blood. 

Again, the rising, deep retching. How loose the soil in my hands is as I grab a fistful - gravel grinded from mighty boulders like limbs are when removed from bodies. Fire dances across my face, lapping at the corners of my eyes with its tendrils. "To my blood, I add my tears that I might curse the man who injured me thus." 

Silence among empty tree branches and stone hills, surrounding me once again as my voice fades. Cool breaks over me, drawing forth fresh convulsions from the hole bored into my very soul. The knife on my hip clatters in its scabbard. I draw it, gazing mutely as its edge calls to my throat. 

What's another body in this field of carnage? What's one more wooden marker, one more spade in the dirt, one more wound for my body? How would a passerby see me? Did I fight to the last? Did I earn the dignity of a proper burial? Or will I be an unknown face amongst a group of forgotten names? 

"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori." Steady is my hand as I prepare myself. But a soft breeze stays the point; fresh in scent as water is clean from the spring, cool as the pool deep in a grotto. The hairs on my arms tingle and wrack my body with a shiver that threatens to rip my wound further. I clutch at the burrowing pain, dropping the weapon with a useless clunk. 

"In even this, I fail! Achlys! Have you filled my ichor with your venom?" With agony, I pull myself from the ground. "Where is the point of misery? What good is it when too much of it will return home with these bodies? What value do I have over everyone else here to have me survive but leave all these better men to die? How much more costly is my blood to theirs?" I yelp as I bend to grab my knife. "There is no greater misery than an undignified death, so come down here and finish the job!" 

Only the echoes of my voice respond. Alone in my mind and in my surroundings, my gaze is again attracted to the fine edge of my knife. "But how can I, when if it were me in the forest of blood-stained bones, I would tell the survivor to cherish his gift of life?" I throw the weapon as hard as my arm can muster. It rings out the contact of metal and settles amongst the dead. 

I bury my face in my arms, leaning for support against the tree. Again it bubbles forth from me, not the black bile but, sobs I never thought I would hear from my own lips. Like a stone falling from a broken crane, the emotions crash over my shoulders and drive my knees to the earth. My stomach burns as the waves of tears clap over the breakwaters of my eyes. With a clenched fist, I pound my thigh. That face. The rigid determination. Only my death would quench his thirst. Clear as if his weapon still pointed at me, he pushes aside a wall of steel men and approaches me as a smile dawns on his lips. He breaks into a sprint andâ€¦ I fall backwards in a ball. Gasping between the tears, I repeat the same line of reassurance: "it's alright."

I shrink in the world, from the size of a human to a hare, a rat, a fly, and to the most scrawny ant. In each direction around me is limitless nature, but not even the most barren plane of existence could make me feel less trapped; like a beaten dog locked in a cage as it watches the river rise to meet it. 

"I killed a man, mama!" Raggedy breaths split my shaking sobs. "But what was I to do when it would be me if I hesitated?" More black bile spills from my mouth. "Oh, to have never spoken to that recruiter when he came to town. If I could go back, I would have spit upon his papers. I would have tarnished his uniform, scuffed his shoes and stolen his hat from his head. I would have ran home and with tears promised my mom I would never kill." 

Agony when again I rise to my feet. Difficult the steps to a fallen polearm. With my feet, I lift the point from the grass. I yelp, but steel myself against the pain bending would have borne. Both hands grasp tenaciously to the wooden pole, pressing the butt into the ground. 

At a small stream, I thump on the stones and plunge my hands into the cold waters. Red tendrils trail behind my fingers, flowing downstream as the churning cleans it from the clear glass flow. I pull my polearm cane to my knee, snapping the point off the end and tossing it into the water. I slowly pull off my uniform and fold it neatly. Under a tree whose roots drink from the stream, I drop my regalia. For a moment, I pause and behold the bloody, dirty hems and the holes and tears across the fabric. "Here I would lie if it were not for Fate." 

I turn, looking back once more at the tree with my uniform and the grove full of the bodies. I sigh, swallowing the chunk of remorse in my throat. "I suppose there's a town downstream."
