<h1>Das Dicke Ende Kommt Los</h1>
<p></p>

If I snap my sanity like a twig,
Would you hold the pieces with love?
If I bled out the shattered glass of my heart,
Would you try to tape them together?
If my lungs stopped pumping oxygen,
Would you be a breath for me?
If I lost myself in the woods of despair,
Would you come looking for me?

Because I know I'd do all that for you
I know that I would drop everything
If it meant bringing you even a moment
A moment of happiness
A moment of peace
A moment of love

Equally, I know you wouldn't do it for me
Equally, I know your eyes don't look out
I know that they're mirrors to yourself
I know this
Consciously
Yet I still believe in something more
That buried in all the black is a beam of light
Would you mind giving me directions?

I emptied my cup of love to the point of debt
Searching for a drop in return
Searching and searching until my feet break
Until my bones are ground to paste
Until I am no longer me;
Just a husk,
A fast food soda cup without even ice left,
A forgotten memory in your mind

I do try to keep moving forward
Even the usually silent visage of God
Has told me what I should know
Has told me the unenviable truth
But I'm stalled out in a desert highway
Bereft of any motion on either horizon
Bereft of any cell signal
Bereft of even the feeling of home

It's time I got moving on
Even when my car is out of gas
Even when death looms in the distance
Even when my limbs refuse motion
Even when all I have is crumbling Will
Will To Power the lights that are
Tied to an unpaid electric bill

The future is an unknowable thing
It only appears when it fills up my rearview
And with this gained hindsight
I know that I was searching for figs in winter
Lakes in a barren desert
Hope in Pandora's empty Box
Something believe in, in a foreign world

The future will come
Bring it what it may
Destroy that which it wills
And bring a modicum of understanding
A modicum of the Will To Power lost
A modicum of love
A modicum of what I once was
