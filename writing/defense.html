<h1>In Defense of Pain</h1>

A Dyson Sphere that sucks up more power than is created
A wheel that spins endlessly and without friction
A tire that tires of trying
A heart that beats once a millennium

A virtuous pagan that's granted the Seventh Level
A betrayer that resides in Satan's frozen heart
A penance
A flagellation
A hurt
A repayment
A rebirth
A new death

A broken chain that holds the chandelier
A fractured board that caves in a deck
A new start
A return to the same ending
A mint condition token of villainy
A decayed center of beauty

A cat-o-nine-lives
A whip of thirty deaths
An exiling to the fiery depths
A safe deposit to Charon

A boat ride down the River of Broken Lives
A boiling pot of living humans
A hill to roll a boulder up that refuses to keep
A sighting of the Furies
A walk along the edge of Tartarus
A question: Hell?
An answer: Yes and No

A short conversation with King Minos
A long staring contest with Cerberus
A crack
A flap
A rising of Hades

An opening of the Door of Death
A free walk back into living
A valueless requiring of clay bodies
A new attempt; this time to succeed

A remembrance of past failings
A clutching of their hands onto you
An endless climb up the mountain
A string of small talk with Vergil

An ascension
A loving
A centering
A reacquaintance with Light

A confused person
A confused soul
A confused heart
A determined fate
A final try
A final victory
