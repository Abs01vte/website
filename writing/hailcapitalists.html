<h1>Hail, Capitalists</h1>

Hail the Overman!
Hail the one that collects
Our surplus value
For his own means

Hail the CEO!
Who makes profit
Off the suffering of all
And puts them into debt

Hail the Materi√©l Producer!
Who builds his empire of empty trinkets
Atop mountains of disillusionment
To sell his snake oil products

Hail the Politician!
Hail the one that sells his policies
To the highest corporate bidder
At the cost of their constituents

Hail the End Consumer!
Who surrenders their hard-earned value
For anything that could bring happiness
But never realizes that what they like
Is the novelty

Hail Corporate Personhood!
For being an oligopoly
Wasn't enough for them
They needed a vote too
