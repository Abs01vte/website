  <h3>Akinzali Inferno</h3>
  <p>

    Bolts of fire from Bresseni boards broke the black blanket brought by the moon. Vaeli vehicles vroomed to life, revving red hot to rebuff the raiders ravaging their ports. Calls came cascading back to command, ordering ordinary soldiers to open ordinance oppression upon the foe. One order ordained a soldier, opining over other obligations, to put posts prescribing preemptive posturing, for allied armadas sailing south of Vaeli arms, past the point of projectiles. Slipping inside a small ship shackled to tilting teatherposts, he untied the twine uniting it with the petra weight, which waved while he wheeled out of the wharf and off to war.
</p>
<p>
Upon passing the Peninsula of Promise, the portly porter of potentially portent epistulas pulled up to the dark grey figures approaching through the seamist. A dismally dark dirge of driving destroyers and wooden deciremes was suddenly dropped on by the doggedly determined defenders of the western banks, dooming many a sailor to the despairing depths of the sea; breaking the backs of the new-born brigade to the booming barrage of buckshot barreling from above; their debt, the brevity of the booking list of boats still benefiting their broken bankroll. Still stirring from the steel-grey sea, the stirling destroyers sail, unassailed, to the assistance of their associates, all available hands aimed to annihilate the attackers in land alien to them.
</p>
<p>
Breaking waves to beat back the brown boats abreast the shore of Berusia, brave boaters blasted away at the enemy and shoreline batteries, bringing bows below the blue with their bold action; beleaguered Bresseni boats backed away, their bravado beaten back by the bountiful bouquet of bullets. Slinking aside the soothing shore, the once stalwart sailors are assigned to solely assist their sister ships; fleeing far from the foe’s firing range, before finally finishing in front of the fatherland. Having halved the haughty harriers, halcyon heroes hailed their haggard allies, heaping honors on them for holding the line under a hail of hate.
</p>
<p>
Heating up in the east, the eager ears of Agrisallan men listen unerringly to the eerie emissions of early rising Vaeli men. Massive muri mount an insurmountable mission for the mal-intended militiamen, which might make many a man mincemeat. Avid assailers against the a-emotional halfbreeds attempted to ascend the ramparts, sending soldiers scaling up just to see them shoved sideways, sailing straight south to their deaths. The clairvoyance of the clever creators of the castle-like construction calling creedence to the clear-cut count of casualties crowding the canon range. Lives lost lamenting beneath the walls, leaving filial bonds to let flies feast fiercely on the forgotten fallen.

<h3>The Lone Performer</h3>
<p>
  The rope dropped from the top of the wooden structure. The man dressed only in black robes grabbed it eagerly, jerking it towards the man who stood alone at the center of the stage, the lone performer. He stood, his hands bound behind his back. He looked high into the sky, the lone performer preparing himself for his routine. With practiced precision, he looked at the wooden stage, the looping and swelling grains in the boards reminding him of the vast ocean churning or of the clouds dancing across the sky, constantly changing and constantly in a state of elegance. The lone performer knew what came next, and almost on cue a third man stepped onto the stage, nodding to the crowd that was gathered anxiously around the elevated floor, looking with grim fascination at the prospect of the lavish production that was about to begin. The new man nodded to the man dressed in black and the man in black handed him the rope. The lone performer’s head was pulled back by the new man, but the lone performer’s calm expression remained unchanged, he was merely going about the performance as he had practiced in his mind all those many hours in his green room which was surrounded by metal bars. The new man stretched the loop at the end of the rope, placing it lovingly around the lone performer’s neck. The strands tickled the lone performer’s neck and under different circumstances, he would itch it and go about his day, but he did not have that luxury, he was at the mercy of the routine. The crowd roared along with the performance, men and women alike cheering with sadistic exuberance at the addition of the rope necklace around the lone performer’s neck. The man dressed in black hit the lever for the lights and the lone performer fell into position. He looked to the sky again and saw that the clouds he so adored turned a shade of red along with the rest of the sky. The crowd’s cheering seemed to fade and get distorted, his stage fright getting the better of him. And with that, he slipped into darkness, the performance ending with a magnificent conclusion.
