<h1>It Comes On Again</h1>

Rage
Rage filling my veins and muscles
An oil tanker filled with conniptions
Anger directed at the whole of the world
Directed at the systems that oppress
Directed at the people who demean
Directed at the tribalism that leaves loners out
Directed at the faulty, felonious words you said
Directed at your backtracking assertions
Borne by crumbling willpower
Borne by years of isolation at your hand
Borne by my dying heart
Borne by my broken back
All decaying in your self-centered horse-blinders

Why do I still give everything I have to help?
Why do I do this knowing I will have nothing left?
Why do I still care when my heart has been
Trampled, crushed, eviscerated, destroyed?
Is it because I try to do right
In a world all-too focused on being wrong?
Is it because I try to right the wrongs I've been dealt?
Or is it simply my desire to destroy myself?
