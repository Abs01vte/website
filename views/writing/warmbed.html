<h1>A Warm Bed For Two</h1>

  Damian nudged John while he slept at the foot of Damian’s bed. It had been many a moon since either of them had felt comfortable enough to sleep alone. Just the presence of the other made everything less tumultuous, less anxiety-inducing. John lazily opened one eye, looking at Damian in a way that screamed “why did you wake me up?” Damian patted the space on the queen bed to his right. John closed his eye and pulled himself up to the spot next to Damian. John fell back asleep almost instantly, to Damian’s dismay. All Damian could do now was tuck John in and hope that he was warm enough. “It really isn’t my place to worry about how comfortable he is, but-” Damian couldn’t let himself finish the thought. He shouldn’t think about that. John was his friend after all, and Damian wasn’t that guy, as much as he sometimes wished he was. No, things were certainly good as they were. “Are you sure?” the thoughts that linger at the back of Damian’s mind asked him callously. Damian didn’t have a response. Both he and the thoughts already knew the answer. It was written as plain as day across Damian’s cheeks everytime he so much as thought about thinking about it.

	Damian rolled onto his left side, careful not to wake John again. He knew that John would talk to him about it when they both woke up in the morning if he did and Damian would have to quickly change the subject before he felt the emotions inside him building up to a fever-pitch. It just isn’t sustainable in its current state. Damian couldn’t ever look John in the eyes. John could see beyond whatever mask Damian put on just by looking into his blue eyes. They understood each other to a level that the other didn't know themself. Damian could tell when John had a bad day just by the way he left his shoes after coming inside. And John, perceptive as ever, felt Damian’s troubles from miles away. They had been friends so long that neither could really pinpoint the moment they both met. As he thought about all this, Damian’s eyes got slowly heavier as the waves of sleepiness washed over him. Before he knew it, the warmth of having a second person under the covers with him sent him off to sleep.

	The morning sun pierced through the curtains, forcing Damian to open his eyes and stare at the blank ceiling of his room. He stretched his arms and could feel his shoulders pop. “Well, at least I slept better than the night before,” Damian thought. Earlier, he had slept on John’s floor. Unfortunately for him, John was such a heavy sleeper that he had long since passed out by the time that Damian felt cold and needed a blanket. Damian chuckled. John had always been a heavy sleeper. He remembered times that he could write on John’s face in permanent marker, move him to a different bed as a joke, or dress him in different clothes all without John even stirring. While caught up in his reveries, the smell of cooking bacon filled Damian’s nostrils. Without hesitation, Damian leapt out of bed and dashed into the kitchen. He quickly threw himself into a chair that sat beneath the counter facing the stove. John didn’t acknowledge Damian’s arrival, but Damian was certain that John had heard him sprint here. And he was certain that John could hear him panting.

	“I knew the bacon would wake you up. It always does.” John mused.
	“It was actually the sun pouring through the curtains that you won’t let me darken.” Damian shot back.
	“Mmhmm.” John scooped the bacon out of the pan with the spatula and gingerly placed them atop a small stack of bacon on a plate with a grease-soaked paper towel. “The reason I don’t let you is because you would sleep until dinner time if you were allowed to. And you don’t eat enough as it is.”
	Damian wanted to say that it was because John only cooked breakfast and dinner, but he held himself back. “But it would be so nice to finally not get a headache everytime the sun decides to rise.”
	John sarcastically laughed. He carried the plate over to the counter and placed it just far enough away from Damian that he didn’t scarf down the whole plate in one bite. John turned back to the stove and pulled a carton of eggs from the fridge. He cracked one and started making them the way Damian likes them: over easy. Damian reached for the bacon, going so slowly that a snail could outrun his hand. He focused intensely on his breathing so that he didn’t give away what he was doing.
	“Not until the rest of the food is ready.” John announced, without even having to turn around.
	“How did you know? I wasn’t even making a sound.” Damian asked, flabbergasted.
	“I know you. That’s more than enough to know what you were doing. Plus, I have eyes in the back of my head.” John flipped the egg over like he was a professional chef.
	“Ha ha. You’re not a mom.” Damian joked.
	“You make me one, Dame.” John stated, in such a dry tone that it soaked up all the moisture in the air. Damian felt that jab hit him right in the heart.

	John finally finished cooking the eggs and brought them to Damian. He didn’t say anything when Damian grabbed half of the stack of bacon and placed it on his plate. He had the experience of understanding that it was useless to stop Damian from getting the bacon when John had no more cards to play against him. Damian looked up after a few moments of quietly eating. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it and flicked his eyes back to his plate. He quietly played with what remained of his eggs and the crumbs of the bacon.

	“What is it, Damian?” John asked, seeing through him.
	“Nothing.” Damian mumbled.
	“No, it isn’t nothing. What is it that you were going to say?” John’s tone got mildly annoyed.
	“I was just going to ask,” Damian looked into John’s steel grey eyes and felt them gaze deep into his soul, “are you going to stay in my room tonight?”
	Damian looked back down at the counter, noticing details in it that he had never noticed before. He waited for John to say something, but an awkward silence fell over them both. Damian could feel John’s eyes burning holes into his head. Then, all of a sudden, he felt John’s warm fingers lightly touching his chin. Damian’s head got slowly pulled until his eyes met John’s.
	“What do you think?” John whispered with a smirk before leaning in. Damian closed his eyes and felt his heart explode. This was what he had been waiting years for.
