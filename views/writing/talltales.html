<h1>Tall Tales</h1>

Is it right to tell a lie
when the truth does more damage?
Is it right to tell the truth
when a lie is what's expected?
Is it wrong to live in silence,
knowing your words will never kill?
Is it wrong to be loquacious,
lashing your bladed tongue around?

Is it correct to carry regrets,
when the remorse isn't your own?
Is it proper to be in sorrow,
knowing your happiness drains others?
Is it justified to reopen wounds
that had just begun to heal?
Is it good and nice and fine
To be the one everyone avoids?

Is it my repayment to be who I am?
Is it my destiny to lie and be a sham?
Is it my right to harm others, and not know?
Is it holy to live without wanting to grow?

It is my right to be the worst,
To see myself become my foil.
For this kindness will be my first:
The day I'm buried in the soil.

It is wrong to spin a tale;
To make the truth perverse,
To string up the listener in the gale,
And lull them with my verse.

My means of expression is much too harsh
To even be considered art.
It's about as clear as a boggy marsh
And as deep as an empty heart.

You have wasted your time in reading,
As I have wasted in creating.
For I see your eyes are pleading
That this will be abating.
