At the zenith of the moon comes the horns of war. A band of nobles, yoking their steeds with controlling knees, cut paths through the grass up to our camp. Surmounting the ramparts over flashing suits of layered metal and rings of steel, Cotta's helmet peeks over wooden beams that are sharp-tipped and dirt-stained from where they had been driven into the earth at a previous construction. He looks out over to a snowy ring around the encampment wherein several moving figures take positions and sling rocks that clank off of helmets and thud off the wood. Archers step forward into the skirmish, thwacking a whistling volley that plunges towards Gaea, taking a throng of Germanians to the soil with them. Whooping and yelling follows their retreat, giving way to the groans of the wounded of both sides and the rustling of their caretakers. 

From over the drifting lights of a candle in the corner of a tent, the Centurion of the First Cohort, Decimius, reports, "All told: half a dozen dead, at least double that in severe wounds. Maybe more have minor wounds that pride hides from our view.” 
“I give thee thanks, Praefectus. What do we know, gentlemen?” Cotta prompts. 
The Centurion of the Third Cohort, Appillus, replies, “Initial reports were that the force was composed of the Eburones, but this most recent skirmish contained many Germanian soldiers in their ranks; judging from the dead, at least.” 
“Any idea on which Germanic tribe is involved or their potential motives?”
“None, Legatus,” the Centurion of the Second Cohort replies.
“A potential migration much like in the Year of Calpurnius and Gabinus,” Gnaeus, one of the Military Tribunes, offers. 
Co-Legatus Sabinus provides his own commentary: “Proof be it that the Eburones have found council in many tribes hither the Rhine as beyond it. When their men ambled to our zone of control, was it not strange to anyone else here that this force was miniscule? I suspect a probing attack. We’ve won this first blood, but they have plenty of it to spare; we shall hold fast and await dawn.”
Legatus Lucius Auruculeius Cotta places his hand on the table as he ponders over what the officers have stated, just as a soldier bursts through the tent flaps and proclaims from an unfurled scroll: 
“Honorable Roman Commanders of Aduatuca, I, Ambiorix of the Eburones, seek to parlay with you considering the matter of your recent action in the Menapii lands as well as your continual lingering in our Belgae territory. Before the second hour, I desire that you meet me in neutral territory with no more than 10 bodyguards accompanying. Having heard tell of your commander’s prowess in battle, dread not that I might betray his trust by defiling the dignity of a Roman ambassador.
I await thy council.”

Morning broke cold over frosted leaves and drifting fog. Familiar metal clanking from Cotta's gear fills his ears as he bends to fasten his sandals, brushing off his feet and plucking his helmet off the washtub. He tucks it under his left arm, toying with the folded metal securing the tang to a decorative pommel with his other hand. A deep sigh. "Be resolute."
All throughout their previous campaign, Quintus Titurius Sabinus had been critical of Lucius' decisions and plans. When Sabinus himself had erred in his decisions, it was the fault of his subordinates– Jupiter save them. Rash. Impulsive. This is Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta's enemy within the gates today. The autonomy he had enjoyed by hosting separate battlegroups withers away with each grain of sand that falls off the lip of an hourglass. 
Another deep sigh. Toughen your soul. Kneel and be beholden unto the Gods, kiss the memento of faraway loved ones, and stride forth to conquer. 

"...but I speak not of ill desire, verily." Cotta catches as his focus shifts from sizing up the enemy bodyguards and to the honey-vinegar voice of Ambiorix. 
"Say if we hold your word, dismantle our walls, pack our things and march off elsewhere, that Sol shall again rise over my head and the heads of my compatriots," Quintus Titurius Sabinus absent-mindedly pats his horse's mane as he speaks. "Can you then perform your solemn duty not to hinder this? Be wary, for any deal your family ring stamps is one made with Caesar himself." 
"My word is only as strong as my nation," Ambiorix bends his head and spreads his arms. "For you to leave our lands is enough to satiate my soul. To ensure you never return, however, is a matter to come."
"I have thoughts," Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta knees his horse to turn him towards Ambiorix, "regarding the matter of surrendering our post."
"Speak them, friend. It would not be a civil parlay if rash actions took precedence over harmless words."
"Verily." Cotta pauses and bursts forth with a torrent: "On the first point of even considering the surrender of my camp—"
"Cotta do not ruin this for me or so help me–-" Sabinus glares with eyes that disappear behind his eyelids.
"—of betraying the Just and Righteous order of our Commander, Julius Caesar…" Cotta, in turn, faces Sabinus. "I frankly find preposterous. You, before the Gods, before the first rank of Centurions, dare to revoke your sacred oath, sworn sworn not to this barbarian," he points to Ambiorix without breaking eye contact with Sabinus, "but to the People of Rome—when indeed you call yourself Roman too. You defile the very ground you stand upon. If Caesar were here, he would—"
"'If Caesar were here'? Caesar is in Italia! He is weeks away from our notice, let alone being able to front the time it takes to coordinate a measured response. By fleeing now, we gain him precious months while saving precious manpower." Sabinus catches his breath before diving into another row. 
"Ahem. I may be 'just smart enough to know an ass from a brothel,' as you once said, but at least I know that divulging our plan to the enemy is a bad idea," Centurion of the Second Cohort, Avinicus, speaks slowly, without moving a muscle in his mouth. 
"I concur with your officer there,” Ambiorix interjects, “but since you have shown me this kindness, I shall offer one in return. Flee now and I shall form up outside the next nearest Roman camp and offer them the same choice I present to you: go or die. It is a very simple plan, certainly not as complex as conquering the world as you Romans enjoy doing." Ambiorix smirks as he finishes. 
Sabinus turns back from scanning the stone faces of the Centurions, "A note for our consideration, surely. But, Cotta," his throat tightens and face runs red, "we should really finish this discussion back in the camp."
"Agreed," Cotta closes his eyes for a moment and tries to collect himself. "I thank you, Dominus Ambiorix of the Eburones, for your time and wisdom."
Ambiorix's face doesn't register Cotta's words, continuing, "I shall return tomorrow at dawn. You decide what I shall find when Sol's light touches your campgrounds." He clicks his tongue and his horse turns around and heads to the Gallic camp. 

"... and I have told you a hundred times over, Quintus, the whole point of building a camp is that we have walls!"
"What you don't understand, and could never get through your skull that's thicker than your pater's strongest oxen, is that when these brave Romans," Sabinus dramatically points around the walls and tents, "start to get hungry, when these proud warriors are laden with nagging wounds: it isn't these walls that will prolong their lives, it is our food. Of which, we have enough to last to muster at snowmelt. Who will feed them, when their tents are filled with more enemies than allies? Who will tend their wounds, when our doctors are enslaved? You? Me?"
Cotta interjects: "There are plenty of examples of these very men standing against hard luck and not buckling. You, Centurion Clausus, when the Nervii killed all but you of your cohort, who saved you?" 
"Uh, myself, Legatus." 
"Did you lose heart? Turn about and betray the orders of Caesar? Did you, then, turn your back on your comrades?"
"Well, I—no, Legatus. I, well, I survived by hiding under my comrades' bodies. When I was found, I got a field promotion… and I—" 
"Have you felt this, my soldiers? Cotta flutters about in his words and falters in his choice of brave Romans!" Sabinus and a section of the rank-and-file of Clausus' Fourth Cohort laugh. "Surely, you wouldn't choose the cook-slave to testify on your behalf next!" 
More laughing, evermore laughing. Cotta's eyes begin to lose focus. Everything he had planned for the previous night… All of his preparation this morning… In his soul, he falls to his knees; but his body freezes in its position like the drops of water suspended in a winter gale. 
Caesar… What would Caesar do? Surely, Sabinus himself would know as well as Cotta, yet here he stands trying to convince his legion of desertion. Sabinus’ cautious approach to the attack was clearly lost to the drive of survival. For, what else but his own life could he value so greatly as to betray the orders of his commander? Certainly not the lives of his soldiers. 
Cotta’s mind stops on a grisly scene in his memory. Cracking whips, screaming Romans, the Devotio of decimation; Sabinus lined them up to determine their fate. The first of a Contubernium to see the scratched and burned “X” on his wooden token had their face fall to the floor and their bodies cracked, crushed, and collapsed with rocks flung by his nine bunkmates under threat of death themselves. Five had already been killed in this way before Cotta returned from his scouting trip. Their bodies… 
His open eyes fall on Sabinus once more.
Cotta's blood boils, shaking his shock to give one last piece of his mind before madness takes over: "With the Gods as my witness, you shall die for this. But, I, for one, am surely considering whether I should trust an enemy that would just as soon hug me as honor his word. And is it not a little convenient, comrades, that Ambiorix has indeed spoken on behalf of his desire to destroy all of our sister legions, yet all Sabinus can consider is how to get out of this alive? What precedent will we set when they all refuse Ambiorix's order and die fighting? You all have considered your stomachs far longer than you have considered your employer. Hunger is a strong feeling, but I don't think a man among us is full.
"Our meals will get thinner, our bodies weaker, but we can prevail. And we must, in fact, for it is our duty! I am not defeated by cold nights, thin gruel or thick enemy lines. But if you all are, then be the first to leave and get killed."
Cotta storms off the stage as Sabinus tries to recover by explaining his trust for the enemy commander.  


<a id="two"><h3>II- The Final Performance </h3></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>

Around the hour of the third watch, the fires go out. Cotta awkwardly straightens his pack while also controlling his horse. Sabinus is up front, Cotta rides along the center and the Military Tribune, Gnaeus, mans the rear of the formation as the sea of bouncing metal rambles its way along. 
Early morning mist drifts over the grass and coats the gaps in the soldiers’ caligae with dripping moisture, caking their feet in a thin layer of mud. With a choppy sigh, Cotta’s horse shakes the dew off her mane. Cotta reaches down and strokes it out with loose fingers, snagging here and there on knots, burrs and twigs. Tense quiet suffocates the air, broken only by the clopping of hooves and the slapping of leather sandals. 
An echoing thud stills the moving sounds. 
“He’s hit! Doctor! General! Someone!” 
Cotta kicks his horse, wrapping his arms around the nape of her neck as she speeds up to a run. Light flashes along the line as the milling soldiers adjust their packs and twirl their javelins in the dirt. A single light follows Cotta at the edge of his right eye, moving as he strains to see it. Returning his eyes to the waving mass of soldiers near the front, the light passes in front of his horse and comes to a rest in the branches above Cotta’s destination. 
“Woah!” Cotta commands his horse, which skids in the loose soil and angrily stomps. As he dismounts, the words fall like rains in the south Ionian Sea at the zenith of winter: “What has happened? Speak now, dear men, present me with your words.”
“Legatus Cotta… it’s Sabinus… he–”
“He has what? Left? Fled? Given us up for copper coins?”
“Cotta…” the field doctor starts, standing up from a body that is face-down in the dirt and surrounded by a pool of sticky, crimson blood. “You and I should take a moment under this tree here,” he gestures to a draping fir. 
“Itā,” Cotta’s eyes remain locked on the body, but his own body moves without thought as his mind grinds to a halt.

“My general, I do not wish to alarm you, but your command is now paramount.”
“My command? You don’t mean that–”
“By Jove, I do. The body you see there over yonder is Quintus. The men say they were marching when they suddenly heard whistling and…” 
Cotta’s focus drops from the conversation and back to the fallen soldier; his plume still straight and tidy on his helmet like it was when it was cleaned last night, one arm splays out, opposite one bent and twisted under his body. 
“Vesta guard my eyes and protect my soul!” Cotta puts a hand up to block out the sight, turning towards the fir and its green needles. 
“This evidently is enough to cause mental anguish, thus I shall leave ye to compose yourself. At your command, we strike again for Legatus Quintus Tullius Cicero’s camp, but four miles from here.” The doctor bows and walks back to the cold corpse of Quintus Titurius Sabinus.
“Unto thee, my deepest thanks,” Cotta says, placing his hand onto the trunk of the tree and placing evermore weight upon it. 

“Quintus…” Cotta’s mind turns like a millstone. An hour before, Quintus was commanding our men. An hour later, he is beholden only unto the grave. Tears well in Cotta’s eyes. “With the Gods as my witness, you shall die for this.” His words had come from a place of hurt and anger, not from genuine desire to see his friend and colleague slain. The Gods, it seems, do not heed the will of man- but their word. 
Sunlight refracts off the dense clouds above, glistening over the leaves like a full moon. A wet droplet hits Cotta’s plume, falling through the horsehair bristles and past the metal, resting at the tip of his head. He swipes his helmet off of his head, feeling not a taste of moisture anywhere in his hair but his brow. Again the drip, again the expanding dot of cold. Cotta looks up. The light that had followed him is sitting on a tree branch. Down it falls, white tendrils glowing in the sunlight, as it morphs into a familiar form. 
“Quintus!” Cotta gasps.
“Truthfully thus,” Sabinus’ face appears from behind the veil of mist as his distant-sounding voice drops a tone to state: “but there is another.”
“Who?”
Quintus Titurius Sabinus’ ethereal form steps to his right, revealing another figure that Cotta cannot place but something about it feels ubiquitous. 
In a voice that echoes, the figure says, “My child, thou hath invoked my presence. Thy words have echoed from the Halls of Olympus to the depths of Tartarus. I have come, fair Cotta, at thy request. Against him, thou hath sought revenge. His life didst thou wish to come to end.” 
The figure spreads its arms, a rainbow expanding out from his center and revealing a world that Cotta has never seen. Gray sludge, filled with the trinkets of children, suits of armor, clothing, limbs, eyes, ears, heads, gold coins, and more, gurgles along through the depths of infinity; at its surface a small rowboat. Its rower moves with quiet dedication, barely disturbing the waters, his robe or the items floating by. Behind him, two dark figures take in the surroundings.
“To Charon shall this Sabinus go,” the figure begins again, closing his arms. 
“Wh– what the…”
“Two gold coins, Cotta,” it taps an extended, wispy hand with another. “Two gold coins and I can take my leave.”
Reason returns to Cotta in bits and pieces, unscrambling his brain from the visions of the beyond. “T-two? If I remember my Homer, the Riverboatman costs one Drachma.”
The figure laughs, revealing his face. It has not a face, but thousands; Cotta’s late grandfather, the centurion he served under in Illyria who was slain by a jumpy recruit on a dark night, Sabinus… and then his own face. Cotta placed a hand over his mouth and the face followed suit. “One… for the departed. One… be thine.” Cotta’s face disappears from the floating being, morphing into one that Cotta had surely seen in the halls of the fallen: Thanatos. 

Cotta leaps backwards with a yelp, slipping on a low-hanging branch and crashing his armor onto the dirt. Half a cohort runs over, taking position around their commander. 
“Be still, my soldiers, be still.” Cotta reaches his hand out for help rising to his feet. Centurion Decimius extends his hand and pulls Cotta from the ground with a steady arm. “I thank you, Decimius.” 
Decimius nods and shouts orders to his men in a rhythmic, Greek cadence: “Ready! Itā! First! Legio aeterna victrix!” 
One contubernium breaks off and forms the front, repeating, “Legio aeterna victrix! Roma o Roma!” 
“Second! Sit Italia sua vis!” As the second contubernium starts marching, Decimius adds, “Cotta!” 
“Roma o Roma, sit Italia sua vis!” 
Cotta joins the school of fish pushing back to the rest of the legion and taking up the advance.
“Third! Nostrum munus patri Marti!” 
“Roma o Roma,” the third set of ten fall in behind Cotta, “nostrum munus patri Marti!” 
“Fourth! Nostrum ferrus Imperatori Caesari!” 
Cotta shouts, “Decimius!” 
“Roma o Roma, nostrum ferrus Imperatori Caesari!”
“Last!” Decimius shouts over his shoulder, “Tota Gallia dēlēndum!”
 “Roma o Roma!” The whole column shouts to the sky, “tota Gallia dēlēndum!”


<a id="three"><h3>III- Two Bloodied Drachma </h3></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>

Half a mile from where Sabinus’ body had been loaded onto a flat grain cart that had long since run out of grain, the bushes began to rustle. Cotta motions for a decanus, whispering in his ear, “Ambush defense. Pass it along. Go.” The decanus nods, ducking below the tower shields of his comrades and tapping men into position as he splits them apart down the middle. 
“You should go too, Legatus. I can handle things here. The men near the back need you more.” Decimius claps Cotta’s leather and chainmail shoulder pads after helping him off his horse.
“Stay alive, Decimius, your daughter needs you to come home.” 
Cotta dashes forward, but takes a glance over his shoulder as a wave of enemies storms out of the shrubs; Centurion Decimius shouts encouragement to his men, standing-by to press back against a buckling line or replace a fallen comrade. Cotta can’t help but have a feeling that the men he passes will no longer be seen by him. So great is the desire to turnabout and confirm their well-being, but greater than that the duty to all his men. He slows near the backs of the last of First Cohort. His eyes catch something in the background: a twirling sling behind a dead shrub. Cotta locks eyes with the slinger, his hand following Cotta’s moves. Cotta freezes, waiting for him to throw so that he could dodge it. The slinger releases. Cotta drops to the pathway, the rock striking a soldier behind him; who coughs and drops to one knee. 
"Part!" Cotta shouts, pushing through the wall of the square and into the Second Cohort's square. In the corner of his eye, the slinger winds up another stone. Cotta stops behind a line of Romans separated from the encircling army by the vanguard and rearguard fighting for their lives. 
“Raise shields!” Cotta orders, the second line lifting their scuta to the air. Not properly for poor Cotta, however. With a THUD and CRUNCH, Cotta collapses to the ground. Blood pools under a cascade of drops. Cotta places a hand on his right cheek, a deep, stinging pain preventing him from even attempting to speak. His hand returns covered in his own blood. Cotta balls his bloody fist, pounding it into the dirt and trying to rise to his feet like he had just chugged four glasses of Falernian wine. With the reassuring hands of Centurion Avinicus and the nearest decanus, Cotta regains his upright stature. 
“I give thee thanks, Avinicus–” Avinicus nods, “and to thee, decanus. Were it not for your help, I would surely have been trampled to death!” 
“You grimaced through half of those words, Legatus. Let the doctor look over you,” Avinicus pours out concern from his eyes and cautiously extends his fingers to the dent in Cotta’s metal cheek flaps. 
Cotta jerks backwards and away from Avinicus’ hand, “I–” he sucks air through his teeth, “am perfectly capable of command.” 
“We have already lost Sabinus, Legatus Cotta. We cannot lose you!”
“My time has not come yet.” Cotta pops his jaw into place and sighs, “Soon, however, it will be.” 
“I am henceforth attaching myself to your command!” Avinicus declares. He turns about to a screaming German and puts his whole body weight behind a shove that moves not only the berserking warrior, but also five ranks of the cohort. 
“You are more than capable,” Cotta cracks his neck. “There is no doubt about that, but your fate is here with the Second Cohort.” He looks over the square of the Second Cohort, spotting a weak spot along the southern wall where only a single line of enemies presses into the battle line. “Break through the south, Avinicus. I will coordinate efforts with the rear. Send along this decanus to the First and relay the same message. We shall overcome them with our training and skill. Meet me in the south and we shall continue to Caesar’s right hand: Labienus.”
“Your command, Legatus.” Avinicus presses into the northern wall of men, growling, “Push against me, comrades! To the south is freedom!”

“...and we shall continue on for Labienus as part of a fighting retreat.” Cotta breathlessly repeats to Centurion Appillus of the Third Cohort. Simultaneously, the sound of a hundred sticks being dragged along the ground overpowers the din of battle. “Testudo!” Cotta screams, his voice cracking and jaw coming out of place once more. Shields rise and form a makeshift roof. Javelins strike several shields, flooding daylight into the shaded hut. One tips a shield away from the metal boss, flinging its holder’s arm down. Another set of javelins falls in behind it, nailing a soldier to the ground. The soldier screams, tears drawing white lines through the grime. More shields have fallen. Shade only covers Cotta and patches of Romans who have not been hit. 
"Brace!" Cotta can barely make noise before a wave of angry Eburones crashes over the metal fence, crumbling it as they spill into the central cavity. His throat seizes as he spots an Eburones warrior sizing him up. He jumps as a hand grabs his shield arm.
"I will do my duty to the Republic, Aurunculeius, come death," Centurion Appillus snarls, charging forward with the battle cry, "occidē!"
"S-soldiers! To me!" Cotta commands, regaining some composure by watching Centurion Appillus engage in single combat with the warrior who shot the death glare.
Appillus blocks the warrior's ax with the scutum resting across his arm, knocking the ax hand aside. He steps into a shield thrust to the warrior's shoulder, dislocating it with a crack audible to Cotta. He follows through with a quick stab to the nape of the warrior's neck, piercing his larynx all the way to the semicircle cross guard. Appillus rips it out, backing up under guard as the warrior gushes out more blood as each part of him hits the ground. Appillius then gets swarmed by seven Eburones and Germanians. He challenges each with, "You want some?" in Gaulish as they crush him into the ground. 
Seven silver swords turn to five as the two on the Centurion's sword arm take a slash of punishment for forgetting Appillus’ training with his weapon. Five bloodied swords turn to four as Appillus stabs one through the chest under his armpit. Four, four, four. Four fell Appillus, but none think to stop stabbing. 
Cotta can barely hold his vomit in as the crowd that attacked Appillus is joined by thirty more who followed the sounds of tense fighting. With his back to his fellow Roman and only his sword and shield between himself and the enemy, he commands, “Extend your shields! Let them throw themselves upon our swords!” 
The weight of the shield is apparent on Cotta instantly, having not carried one since the founding of the legion he commands. He manages to keep it extended long enough for a warrior to charge. The Gaul bashes Cotta’s shield back, exposing his sword tip. Threading the cross guard of his sword between the shield pressed against his chest and his comrade’s shield to his right, Cotta plunges the sword into the warrior’s exposed abdomen; but it is not immediately fatal. Cotta is pushed back by the warrior’s attack, his shield scratching his chainmail loops against his chest. As Cotta slides his right foot back, it catches his comrade’s foot, making him lose balance. In the gap, the warrior unleashes his ultimate attack: taking off a Roman’s helmet by stabbing him through the face. Cotta flinches his head back, the tip of the blade digging into his low-hanging jaw and bifurcating his cerebellum. His breath comes out as a gurgle in his throat while he falls back with the Gallic warrior. 


<a id="four"><h3>Hades' Gates </h3></a><a href="#top"style="color: #C5C31E">		back to top</a>

Thick layers of clouds is all Cotta can see. Distorted sounds of battle slow and give way to cheers of victory in German and Gaulish. The voices fade away, one by one. Then, Centurion Avinicus appears. Casting aside his helmet, he throws the dead Gaul off of Cotta. 
Gingerly cradling his head, Avinicus whispers, “I have always loved you, Cotta. I couldn’t let anyone else be the one to kill you; only I could give you a dignified end.”
Cotta coughs, then is shocked to hear himself ask, “But how? You have known me less than a year. How could you have always loved me?”
Avinicus smiles, his lamilar metal armor morphing into brilliant white wings and his face resembling Thanatos in the cheeks and lips, while the eyes fill with the determined excitement of a wolf taking down a deer. He raises a thin, pointy dagger above his head, the mid-morning sun lighting his face in its reflection. He plunges the dagger into Cotta’s chest and buries his fist within. With a yank and a flap of his wings, he pulls Cotta from the ground. Movement is restored to the soul’s body as he turns around to see the corpse of Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta. With another powerful flap Thanatos reaches his apogee, tossing the soul of Cotta and catching it under the arms. Thanatos grins as he tucks his wings into his body, falling over backwards to the earth. The soul of Cotta gasps, but Thanatos only smiles wider. The earth opens up and the two drop through the gap as dirt and weapons stream past them. 
Fields of magma light up the endless cavern in blood orange. “Last chance for sight,” Thanatos sneers. Cotta looks up as the crack in the ground closes up, the bright white no longer visible. A dark stone platform rushes up to Cotta from below. Thanatos spreads his wings, tilting them back and flapping right above the floor. Solidity fills Cotta’s feet as Thanatos places him before a queue to Charon's boat. With a powerful flap, Thanatos flies up and disappears quickly behind the deep, red-lit smoke. 

"You have come at last…" a voice states from Cotta's right. It's Sabinus, dressed in full uniform save for his helmet. "Hours I have waited for you- hours of life that you had stolen from me." He laughs suddenly, "Oh… but I know your fate, my old comrade. I know the price for your curse; I know its punishment…"
"Sabinus, now of all times is not the occasion for being cryptic, bordering on unnerving," Cotta replies, an eyebrow to the surface world. 
Charon interrupts by striding past the line of Romans and Eburones over to the pair. Over his face is a simple mask with eyeholes and a slit for his mouth, the bronze color standing out against the muted grey robe that runs from throat to a stride behind his feet on the ground. He announces in a voice that silences all voices around him: "If ye both be willing, thy boat awaits." 
He turns to leave, but Cotta dashes behind and inquires right after, "Our boat?"
"Truthfully thus, Aurunculeius Cotta," Charon answers, physically unresponsive to Cotta's presence. "Thou hath paid thy toll by the pockets of Thanatos. Young Titurius Sabinus and thy Drachma reached me when he had flown down."
"Sabinus?" Cotta whirls around and spots Sabinus following behind, grinning so far and wide that his head would split at the ears like it was on a hinge. "Do you know anything about the punishment he mentioned to me?"
"It is not mine to share the fate of the deceased, just as it is not mine to know it," Charon replies without a note of emotion in his deep, weathered voice. 
"Then you shall have to fill in the gaps," Cotta threatens Sabinus with a glare. 
Sabinus only laughs as they reach the dock.
"Get into the vessel, young officers. The Judges await on the other side," Charon floats into the boat. Producing an oar from the air, he waves Cotta and Sabinus into the boat with him. They comply, bumping each other and nearly flipping the boat into the Styx. Charon paddles within the river of air, smoke and debris, the current of the water below drawing more strength and speed on the boat than his churning. As the river turns, the true entrance to the Underworld unfolds. Braziers of teal fire mark the unloading point; trailing thin red flames lining the way to a covered stall under the glowing red of the distant bubbling magma. 
"Good luck," Charon gives a strong stroke away from port, turning and slowing the boat to a stop, "and beware Cerberus." He kicks them out with a "Farewell." 

"Lucius… Aurunculeius… Cotta… Cause of death: combat wounds," Agamemnon of Sparta reads from a scroll, glancing up to confirm Cotta's identity. "Normally it ends there, but you have a note." He shuffles the scroll down, "Fate: Asphodel Meadows, bound to Sabinus." He rolls the scroll back up and places it on a stack taller than any building Cotta has ever seen, "You're free to leave. Next!"
Cotta walks past him and sees Cerberus looming over the door to Pluto's palace. Sabinus walks over from the judgment booth, no longer grinning. He extends his left arm, a shackle forming with chains growing towards Cotta's right wrist. 
"What happened to being all cocky?"
"Shut up." Sabinus turns his face away and drags Cotta by the five foot metal connection. 

	Cerberus’ left head snarls at Sabinus while the middle head coughs up the armor of a warrior followed by the warrior’s bones. Under the torrential sucking force of the right head's sniffing, Cotta and Sabinus are allowed to pass through the gate. Three paths spread out before them: one to the grey grass and dead trees of the Asphodel Meadows; the center going down to the Fields of Torment and beyond that to Tartarus; and the last passing by a glimmering lake with deep green islands marking Elysium. 

"Left, then?" Cotta inquires, knowing Sabinus would only grunt his approval. 
"For you two, maybe," someone says from behind them, walking up to the crossroads. 
"Hekate and Janus have seen to it that my path goes to Elysium!"
"State your name, stranger!" Sabinus challenges, thrusting them both around to face the speaker. 
"Avinicus?" Cotta gasps.
"Oh, great… you." Sabinus sighs, "How have you gotten Elysium when your honor was defiled after joining Centurion Decimius' bed as the passive partner?"
Avinicus laughs, "Still mad about that, I see!" He straightens his toga, "This is the third glorious life I have lived; the third consummated with an honorable death. Maybe you could join me too," he smirks as he flicks his eyes to Cotta, "after losing your leash to this rabid dog." 
Sabinus barks out, "I detest that!"
"Maybe I shall see you there." Cotta jangles his chain, "Once this is released."
"Eternity would be too long a wait," Sabinus angrily yanks the chain, moving Cotta’s arm. 
Avinicus covers his eyes and lets loose a frustrated sigh. "Sabinus… just turn around and let me speak with Cotta."
"You have no power over–"
Cotta kicks out Sabinus' legs at the knees, toppling him to the stone pathway. Sabinus mutters angrily as Avinicus steps to Cotta's right ear. 
"I shall wait for you. Decimius is half the man you are."
Cotta's voice catches in his throat, his face burning red. "Y-you meant the words you said before Thanatos dragged me down here?"
"Yes. I asked him to relay them to you. I had worried that he would not, but it appears he has."
"I spoke then of my confusion after the timeliness of developing these feelings for me."
Avinicus' smile wavers, "The sun sets in minutes… is it not still beautiful?"
"I don't understand, what–"
"Come on, Cotta!" Sabinus appears from the side, pulling at Cotta's arm with one hand and the chain with the other. "Asphodel awaits us!"
"Before you go," Avinicus presses a golden locket into Cotta's hand, "take this. When it returns to me, I shall know you have gone to be reborn and that one more lifetime will see you with me."
"But how do you know I've earned an honorable life already?"
"You're the man I love."
"But–" Cotta is pulled down the path by Sabinus. 
"Avē atque valē," Avinicus waves and departs down the path to Elysium.
