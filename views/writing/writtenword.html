<h1>Written Word Journey</h1>
<pre>
<p>  Books.
  I dive into them to blot out the world around me
  Their depths speak in volumes and in chapters
  But my life speaks in jumbled phrases and confusing
  sentences.

  Whether it was to drown out boring lectures
  Containing lessons that my books had told
  Or to avoid hearing the endless jabber around
  Or to stay quiet and not bring trouble

  My parents, loving and caring when they wanted
  Told me what they wanted me to do more than
  I knew what I wanted
  I mean, what could school tell me that an hour with a book
  Couldn’t?

  Could reading them what I have written convince them
  That whatever career they see as profitable
  Isn’t for me. That I am bred to walk my own line
  And tow my own party flag, and not another’s

  But how can I speak to them with my vocal cords
  When all I speak is words and their connotations
  The tones from the writer and what they mean
  Why not then the tones and words of others?
  And why only when I’m the one being spoken to?

  I guess all I can do now is to walk the way they want
  By day
  And walk in a direction of my choosing
  By night

  But won’t that just leave me walking in circles?</p>
