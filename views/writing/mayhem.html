<h1>Pure Fucking Mayhem</h1>

“Dead,” the stage manager prompted.

Pelle looked up at the manager and nodded. A casket was carried over by Hellhammer, Count Grishnackh and Euronymous; Dead’s bandmates. Pelle, known by the scene as “Dead”, stood up and stepped into the cramped, wooden casket. The lid was slowly closed and he knocked on the inside of the lid to show that he was ready to be lifted. He crossed his arms like a pharaoh and stared blankly at the lid. His mind buzzed like a beehive after being hit by a rock. He remembered how he clinically died as a kid, how it inspired his name and his obsession with death. “Speaking of” he thought, pulling out his bag of dead ravens and squirrels. He opened the bag and the entire casket filled with the rotting stench of dead animals. Dead pushed his nose into the bag and inhaled deeply. His lungs burned from the smell and his stomach churned, but despite it all, he felt more alive than he had felt at any time before. At least since the last concert.

The crowd chanted “May-hem! May-hem!” in anticipation of the band’s set. The stage manager gestured to the band members carrying Dead, as they grunted to hoist the casket to their shoulders. The pallbearers of the living solemnly marched onto the stage whilst the sound of a harsh rainstorm was played over the speakers. “It improves the ambiance!” Varg, known as “Count Grishnackh” had told Øystein, “Euronymous”, the night before. The crowd erupted into cheers when they saw Mayhem mount the stage with a large casket. They placed it next to the microphone, so that Dead could do his thing.

Dead kicked open the casket, slowly rising to his feet like a vampire waking from a thousand year slumber, and nearly tripped on the pig heads staked on the stage. He felt his chest vibrate at a high frequency as he shrieked in trve black metal fashion. He heard Hellhammer start playing the drums to show off his skill. He went from pumping the double bass pedals to playing blast beats as fast as he could to playing some fills faintly reminiscent of Buddy Rich, but with more speed, sloppiness and Satanism. Hellhammer finished his fills and started clacking his drumsticks together to set up the time to their opening track, “Deathcrush”.

Euronymous paused the video of the concert in Strasbourg, Norway in 1990, looking at Varg with an odd amount of anger and distaste. Varg had been lost in memory of what Dead had told him that he had felt during the concert.

“Why’d you stop the video?” Varg asked, returning Euronymous’ piercing glare.
“You weren’t watching.”
“I was. I was remembering Dead at his best.”

Varg knew that this would hit Euronymous in the heart in some way. Euronymous was, in fact, the one who had stumbled upon Pelle’s dead body. Varg only knew what happened because Necrobutcher (the old bassist) had received a call from Euronymous the day Euronymous found Pelle. According to Necrobutcher, Euronymous couldn’t find the keys to the house he and Pelle lived in, so he climbed through a window and found Dead lying in his bedroom with slit wrists and a slit throat, his brain splattered against the walls and slopped onto the floor, and a note that said “excuse all the blood”. Euronymous left to get a disposable camera, photographed the scene after arranging the shotgun Pelle killed himself with and the knife he had cut himself with, and made necklaces out of the skull bits to give to other musicians that he deemed worthy.

Euronymous smirked at Varg after he said that. “I’m sure you already know what I would say about that. I’ve said it ever since I first saw him… lying there and doing something beautiful. Something he could never have achieved in coolness had he not done that.”
“You’re messed up, man.” Varg, shocked, replied.
“More messed up than a man who has burned down 8 churches? More messed up than saying you’re a Satanist and not following through with it? Tell me, Count Grishnackh, why do you wear a pentagram when you are a- what do you call it? Ah, yes ‘Odalist’, or whatever.” Euronymous coughed to clear his throat of the blasphemy of which he spoke. “I honestly don’t know why I allow you to stick around in the band.”
“Listen,” Varg could feel his throat tighten with the pain rising up in his chest, “you know as well as I do that I am true to the Black Metal scene. At the Fantoft Stave Church, you saw me sling the molotovs into the church, did you not? Was I not as anti-Christian as the rest? Besides, what is truly wrong with not being a full Satanist? Are we not just out to spite the sheep Christians?”
Euronymous shook his head and tisked Varg, “You must be the one that is making Black Metal become commercialized and attracting poseurs!” He laughed maniacally, then stared intensely into Varg’s eyes, searching for any kind of weaknesses he could find. He then quickly flicked his eyes to the clock. “Oh, Varg, I think it’s time for you to start heading home, no?” He smiled in a slightly devious way, “I wouldn’t want you getting hurt.”
“You’re right, Euronymous, I should.”

Varg waved tightly and strode out of the door. His feet clinked as he trotted down Euronymous’ metal stairs. He felt the cold on his skin and felt that something was going to happen in that spot. He knew what and why, but he did not know who would come out on top.

After a few weeks, he drove out to Oslo from Bergen after receiving a strange letter from Euronymous. In it, Euronymous asked him if they were still friends. Varg thought it was weird seeing as he had been informed by a mutual friend that Euronymous wished to kidnap Varg. That he wanted to tie him up and record a snuff film of Varg being tortured to death. Varg normally wouldn’t have cared, but Euronymous only said it to a select group of people. Varg knew that if Euronymous wasn’t serious, he would have spoken about it in Helvete, but, seeing as that wasn’t what he did, Varg had reason to believe that it was a serious threat. He resolved to drive to Oslo and sign a contract for separating Burzum from Helvete, but be ready for Euronymous to try and capture him.

He opened his car door and sat inside, waiting for the guitarist, Blackthorn, to enter. Varg heard him close the door behind him with a gesture to start driving. Varg flicked on his 8 track player. Celtic Frost’s To Mega Therion began blasting over the stereo. Varg bobbed his head along to the driving riffs, sort of sounding like harsher punk, but with a small dash of Thrash influences. He knew it wasn’t truly Black Metal, but Euronymous listened to synth music. “That absolute abomination of music,” Varg thought. “He thinks he can preach to me about the ‘Trve Black Metal’ ways, but he scarcely lives it on his own.” Varg thought that Euronymous- no, Øystein- needed to be taken down a peg.

Blackthorn starts to step out of the car, but Varg waves for him to stop.
“I know you wanna go show Euronymous some riffs, but we have some contracts to sign, so stay here for just a moment.”
Blackthorn pulls out a cigarette, lighting it up and taking a quick drag from it. “Okay, Count.” Blackthorn keeps smoking and never gives Varg a glance as he ascends.

Varg stretches as he walks up the stairs to Euronymous’ house. He stops right before the welcome mat, taking a deep breath before taking the final stride towards Euronymous’ door. Varg knocks with the back of his hand, stepping back a few inches. Euronymous calls out that he was sleeping and Varg hears him start to snore again. Varg knocks again, louder. Euronymous’ footsteps echoed in the apartment, nearing the door with every passing second. Euronymous throws open the door, glaring at Varg with baggy eyes.

“What?” Euronymous demands.
“You sent me a letter telling me to come over and sign the contract for Burzum in person.” Varg slips his hand into his back pocket, knowing that he has his pocket knife in there.
“Oh, yeah, I did.” Euronymous reaches up and rubs some sleep from his eyes.
Varg slips his hand back out of his pocket, “Mind if I come in?”
Euronymous froze momentarily, staring for a second. “S-sure.”
“Okay.”

Varg pushes past him and stands in Euronymous’ living room. He looks around cautiously, searching for any place that weapons could be stored. The layout hasn't changed since Varg had last been there, but that does little to deter his anxiety. Euronymous slams the door behind them and walks over to Varg. Varg takes a small step forward to begin speaking. Euronymous turns and bolts off to his bedroom. Varg instantly realizes that Euronymous is going to get a stungun and tie him up, so he sprints after Euronymous; dead on his heels until the bedroom door. Euronymous turns and kicks Varg in the chest. Varg staggers backwards, clutching his chest and gasping.

Euronymous’ heart thudded in his chest as his lungs struggled to get air. He feels his legs tremble, his arms hang at his side like dead weights. He has to make a conscious effort to not urinate in his jeans. He had only one other way to exit the building, so he was going to take it.

Varg steps in the way as Euronymous tries to muscle past him. “Getting to the kitchen in order to get a knife and commit his sick acts with it,” Varg thought distastefully. He shoved Euronymous back. Euronymous makes a dash towards his room again, “likely to get Dead's shotgun,” Varg rationalizes. Euronymous thrusts the door to his room open, trying to fling himself out of the window and onto the fire escape. But, Varg slams him into a potted plant. The porcelain shards embed themselves into Euronymous’ back, and he collapses into a bloody puddle beneath his feet.

Varg hears someone behind him. It's Blackthorn. Fear is written clearly across his face as he sees Euronymous sprawled out in his own blood; twitching and struggling to move his limbs. Blackthorn sprints off to the car in a panic. Varg looks back at the crumpled mess of human that is Euronymous. “Blackthorn has my car keys right now, so I should calm him down before he leaves. But I can't just leave Euronymous here. He is likely to sneak up behind me and slip a knife into my spine, so going to Blackthorn now would not be a good idea, besides I don't know if he is colluding with Euronymous.” Varg pulls out his knife, clicking it into the locked position. His first strike lands right into Euronymous’ skull, killing him instantly. Blood splatters across the walls as strike after strike lands on Euronymous’ chest and throat. Varg pulls away, catching his breath. He decides that's enough and turns to go find Blackthorn.

“Hey, man!” Varg calls to Blackthorn, blood dripping from his shirt.
“Oh. Uh… hi.” Blackthorn refuses to make eye-contact with Varg. Or even look in his direction.
“So, are we going to get in the car and go home?”
“I guess so, Varg.” Blackthorn stares blankly at the hood of the car, trying not to provoke Varg.
“Alright. Just let me stop at the nearby lake to drop of my- uh… soiled clothes.” Varg looks at his blood-stained t-shirt with very little emotion on his face and eyes.

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>

              “Well, Hellhammer, did you hear about what happened in Oslo?” Necrobutcher leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of the beer in his hand.
              “I heard the Black Metal police were killed and the killer is none other than the Count of Burzum.” Hellhammer scratched behind his ear, barely reacting to the topic at hand.
              “That's what I heard. Good riddance. After what he did to Dead, he has earned this.”
              “You're right. His parents asked me to cover Varg's bass parts in our new album, but there's two things with that. One: I don't know how to play bass. Two: even if I did, I would want the murderer and the murdered on the same album.” Hellhammer tapped the ash off of his cigarette.
              “What was the name of the album, again?” Necrobutcher asked, leaning forward.
              “De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. I think the burning church on the cover just solidifies the album.”
              “I agree.” Necrobutcher leaned back again, as a hush fell over the two. Something lingered in the air, unspoken. Both were just waiting for the other to ask it.
              “What will come of Mayhem now?”
