<h1>Icarus Redux</h1>
<pre>
I’m d												d
	d												d
	darting through the sky,

			   urging my wings to			             slice the cerulean

	    haze. Each flap pushes me higher, higher, higher! above the ground, houses becoming

			dot		dot		dot		dot	                      dots.

				     “Bring the rain! Bring the thunder! I can take it!”
					I shout, twirling through a grey cloud.

						            l
					            	behind my legs, marking my path
				          	from cotton ball to cotton ball
			        	and towards the glowing orange orb
		    	hanging like a ripe fruit, waiting to
	    be plucked; a trophy to bear
	and prove that I am what I say I am.


	But deep within, I know that it can lead me to unprecedented highs
	            and also my		        	inevitable
	                            fa-

	                            fa-

	                            fall.

	      I reach out to the Sun, hoping it can hold me up
	                    but		       my vision
												fades		to
	                      <b>BLACK</b>

	                  down down down down

	                       to Earth



	                       I awake
	                       to see a
	                       massive
	                      earthen
	                      wall to
	                       wering
	                       over me
	                      but it
	                        has a

	                        hole
	                       to the
	                       other
	                       side.


	      	I could ascend above the mass
	      					or I could shoot through that cave
	      									       and reach the other side
	      									       “Don’t delay me! I must
	      									go
	      								faster!”
	      flap 		flap			flap 			tuck			SNAG

	      	my 		wings stay		on the other		side
	      		the			only			thing
	      			left is the		cold, dark
	      				         ocean.





	I lie on my back at the bottom of the sea, the saline water gently gliding across my body.
			The sun’s rays barely reach me, but I can see the water lit up by its presence.
	To my dismay, the sun disappears behind the peaks of the mountains I tried to circumvent,
															casting the ocean into black

	But 	all of a sudden 		I see				light.

			the bright greens 	neon pinks	dazzling whites
	        shimmer on the bubbles 	slipping from		my pale blue lips
	a beautiful sight 	to behold	right before my light
	   fades

	    I close my eyes for one last time; those bright lights being too good for my eyes to behold.

	I feel
		myself
			rising
				above
					the seabed
						       carried by the
								     comforting hands
										         of something, not sure
				yet, my head breaks the surface of the water
	I gasp,		I choke, 	I hack, 		but I breathe.

		I float on the troughs of waves		pushing me to shore

				and I realize: the way above is not to stand on others’ heads
			but in climbing the mountain with my own two hands

	            and from my chest, a light appears
	         drawing it out, a miniature star floats
	             above my palm that beckons me
	              to walk, rather than to fly.
