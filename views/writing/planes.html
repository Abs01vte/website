<h1>Stiff Upper Lip</h1>

Dark shadows hung over the horizon as the sun slowly slid into the sea. Minor radio chatter echoed across the sleepy landscape, with many military positions preparing to switch shifts. The air churned around the spinning propellers of the shadows. Their deep, arching Vs spread across the sky as the accompanying fighters danced around the formations to ward off any retaliation. They were entirely unnoticed by their targets until one man who had been asleep at the radar station was suddenly awoken by a loud ping through his headset. He did not have the time to wipe the sleep from his eyes, nor to even understand his surroundings. He tapped out a quick message on the radio, for he forgot how to speak; three short taps, three long taps, three short taps.

A single runner sprinted through the halls, pushing over the men in his way, straining to reach the room that called out SOS. As he neared, he saw that other radar stations were alight with warnings of incoming aircraft, but were unmanned as those who manned it before and after were having a short talk before changing shifts. He gathered that the one who called for help was warning about the aircraft, but he was obligated to check on his health as well. His shoes squeaked as he slid on the sides of his feet down the hallway, grabbing the doorframe with the very tips of his fingers to bring himself to enough of a stop to slingshot through the door. And there he was; his hair poking out in odd places, eyes barely held open with sleep ringing his eyelashes. He yawned. The runner walked over to the radar, his chest heaving from the sprint. He saw that there was a lot of pings on the screen and phoned in the necessary warning for the RAF to respond. He figured that with such a loud SOS signal, that the planes would already be scrambling, but he had to follow protocol nonetheless. He put down the receiver and patted the shoulder of the sleepy radar technician. He deserved rest in a soft bed.

	A low growl sounded over the airfields as engines roared to life in gunmetal grey planes that slid from their hangars and prepared to hit the runway. Engineers ran about the tarmac like ants branching out to help move the next bit of food; carrying supplies, checking that those carrying the food are able to and sending off the ordinance with a loving pat. Planes leapt into the air from the runway one after the other with the space between the planes dropping to only a few yards to maximize the amount of planes in the air. The shadows drew ever closer as the gunmetal grey planes shot from the earth to reach the clouds that the targets hid behind. Spitfires rose at steep angles in an attempt to break out of low altitude to reach the JU88s that circled above their homeland. Out from the clouds a squadron of Messerschmitt BF-109s appeared, firing off glowing rounds that streaked past the Spitfires and steamed in the cold, high altitude air. The Spitfires returned their greeting with one in kind, sending one of the BF-109s hurtling to his grave in a shroud of black smoke as flames trailed from the engines of his fighter. As the smoking plane fell past the mainline of the Spitfires, the pilot tried to eject, but the flames had overtaken the fuel tanks and he went up in a ball of fire, scattering parts of his plane across the sky as they drifted back down to earth on foreign soil. One of the other pilots radioed in to his officer “Herr, Rot Fünf ist tot.” He let go of the two receivers on his throat and put his hand back on his controls, edging the throttle higher to chase after the Spitfire in front of him with a tight arc. “Verstanden, Weiß Zwei, nehmen die Briten aus.” came the brief reply. White Two felt his plane rattle as he laid down suppressing fire on the Spitfire dancing around his reticle. None of his shots seem to find their mark, but he wasn’t deterred. He kept up the assault to “take out the British”, as his Kommandant said.

Bravo Zulu Zero jerked his yoke to avoid a spray of bullets from the Kraut behind him. He slid deeper into his seat as the g-force of his constrained maneuver rose past two. His face slid down towards his headrest, but his eyes remained trained on the altitude gauge, for it was climbing fast. The Krauts had chosen a rather high altitude today, Bravo Zulu Zero thought to himself as he watched the meter hit 36,000 feet. He had 4,000 feet of leeway before his engine would being failing. And he couldn’t let that happen. He pulled his spade shaped yoke back even further -should such a thing be possible- to bring himself into an inverted dive. He flipped the throttle back a few ticks to bring himself to slow descent. But the craft still seemed to want to speed up, as he noticed, reaching an overall speed of about 300 mph as he fell to earth with bullets whipping by him. His Kraut shadow did not notice that Bravo Zulu Zero had slowed and plowed past him at 400 mph. The Kraut pulled himself into a bank of about 70 degrees and attempted to shake Bravo Zulu Zero off his tail. But the British pilot stuck right with him.

White Two looked behind him and saw that the plane he chased down was now right on his tail. His maneuver had failed, but he wasn’t shaken by this. He knew that dog fights were a game of cat and mouse with the sides flipping constantly. In the end, the one who could out-maneuver the other would be the one to fly home. White Two reached out with his free hand to stroke the picture of his sweetheart back home. Her name was Ava. She was the daughter of the owner of a small general store on Krausestraẞe and would sneak out to visit White Two before he was shipped off to the Luftwaffe. A loud crack shook White Two from his daydreams. He felt a dense breeze in the cockpit, which could only mean one thing. He located the hole in the back half of the canopy, about 4 inches from the main body of the aircraft. The glass had formed little ridges around the point of impact, with small cracks extending from the center. It wasn’t detrimental to the cause. It was just a minor annoyance for the seasoned pilot. He readjusted his headset as he went into a narrow barrel roll to dodge any further shots from the Inselaffe on his tail. As he straightened out after the turn, he noticed that a Brit plane was flying perpendicular to him. They were around 40 meters to the right and less than 4 meters above him. White Two gently pulled back on the yoke, bringing himself to the 4 meter butter-zone. He made one last look to the right to confirm that the Brit was in position and noticed that behind him was Schwarz Drei. White Two was not certain that Black Three would make it out of this alive, but he figured that two dead Brits for the price of one Übermensch was a good trade-off. So he kicked up the throttle and sharply pulled up, just short of colliding with the Brit.

Bravo Zulu Zero watched helplessly as he hurtled towards his comrade. He threw himself into a 90 degree turn to try and ward off coming collision, but his vertical stabilizer caught his comrade’s tail boom and swung the Brit around and into the Kraut chasing him. The Brit pilot tried to escape the cockpit, but he dangled out of the ejected canopy like a wet rag on the side of a bucket, his parachute pluming behind him, trying desperately to pull him from the burning craft and into safety. But in vain. The smoking planes that had collided burst into flames as they slowly plummeted to earth. Bravo Zulu Zero had his tail boom ripped from the fuselage. He jerked the yoke in various directions to check the hydraulics. The Spitfire feebly responded. His hydraulics gauge dropped ever lower as he tried to put the plane at a gentle decline using only his ailerons. It barely made it to a negative 5 degree incline. He heard a loud sputtering noise as his engine started to cut out. He flipped off the fuel, hoping to try and prevent a possible fire. Then, the Kraut appeared above him and loosed a massive volley of 15x96mm rounds into his disabled foe.

The rounds whipped by Bravo Zulu Zero as the tracers in each set grew steadily closer to the cockpit. The Brit had one last trick up his sleeves to try and escape certain death. He threw his spade shaped yoke fast to the right and held it as far as it will go. The plane yearned to move in accordance with its new orders. It loosed a loud groan and lifted its left wing to the sky as fast as its drained limbs could move. It reached 90 degrees by the time the rounds of the Kraut had zeroed in on Bravo Zulu Zero. The canvas hide of the Spitfire rippled and shook with every bullet that slammed into it. The intrepid Spitfire continued its arduous task to obey its commands and continued to slowly turn until it was completely turned over. The destructive bullets broke through the underside of the Spitfire, peppering it with black holes that threatened the life of the pilot. Bravo Zulu Zero pulled the ejection lever and the canopy shot off and he followed closely behind it. He fell unceremoniously to earth with his plane drifting far above him. Within a moment, it shuddered and exploded. Bravo Zulu Zero was no longer his callsign. He pulled the cord to release the parachute and watched the countryside of his homeland come closer with every passing second.

The JU88s had finally made it to bombing range with London in sight. Their nighttime sortie had begun to pay off. Searchlights raked the clouds, looking for any sign of the German bombers, but they found nothing. Bright lights streaked through the sky in pairs of two, hoping to fell a bomber. The large city was under lockdown as the sirens of an air raid blared. Citizens hid in any makeshift bomb shelter they could find, clutching whatever they cherished deeply. Mothers held their children, who clung to their teddy bears or dolls. A few boys clutched a picture of their older brother in his army uniform, smiling brightly for the camera. The soldiers were gone now, far away from the house they hid in. Probably just escaped from Northern France, after hoping to escape Dunkirk, or lying dead in Narvik; trying in vain to stop the Germans from receiving Swedish iron to build more armor and weaponry. The boys hoped their brother was still around to come home and smile at them as they did in the picture. Sadly, many of those brothers would never return home. They would never smile at their families or bury their brothers in hugs or be here, in London, to defend their homes. There was nothing any of the soldiers overseas could do to help their families. And there was nothing that could stop the unrelenting force of a bomb.

Private Harrison dashed through the rubble strewn streets as the bright flashes of the bombs cut through the dim light of the moon. He strained to carry the AAA ammo that pulled at his hands. The pit was close to where he was, only two blocks, but that was two blocks of fire. He felt his chest heave with exertion, but he stiffened his resolve to go forth. He started his legs moving, a train beginning to chug, he picked up speed and reached a full sprint by the time he crossed the first street. A BF-109 swooped down in front of him and fired off a few rounds to harass him. The bullets smacked down on the concrete, kicking dust up where they landed and rose a cacophony that hurt Harrison’s ears. He picked himself up from where he went prone and continued moving. A bomb crashed into a building to his right and he was thrown over to the sidewalk, covered in debris. He coughed and slowly pulled himself to his feet, dull pains breaking out across his legs and flank. He limped over to the AAA pit and found half the men inside laying on the sandbags with blood dripping from their backs, their chests, their eyes, their mouths, their throats… torn to bits by shrapnel.

“Ammo dump.” Private Harrison announced, throwing the boxes that hung over his shoulder into the pit.
One of the gunners nodded to him, and before Harrison turned away, caught his eye.
“Do you think I could bother you to get me one more thing?”
“It’s my job.” Harrison replied simply.
The soldier nervously laughed as another loud boom signalled that yet another ammo dump or factory had gone up in flames. “Do you have any medical supplies?”
Private Harrison looked at the dead men scattered in the pit ”For these guys? It’s unfortunately too late for them.”
“Surely there’s something you can do! Get a medic… or I guess a mortician.”
Harrison turned to leave, but stopped. He called over his shoulder, “I’m not sure what to do, but I’ll do something.”

Private Harrison collapsed in the HQ foyer. His green tinted dungarees now lightened to a bright beige from the dust. Under his arms and around his neck were a deep brown, nearing black, from the amount of sweat that he perspired. He sighed heavily as he could finally feel somewhat cool from the fans in the room next to the foyer. He sat up and groaned slightly as he pulled himself back to his feet. He opened the door and walked through the empty office space. They had evacuated to the basement to avoid the bombs raining down from the bomb bays of the merciless Krauts.

“Feuer Frei!” The bombardier called out to his pilots as he pushed out the last bomb in the hold. “Verstanden,” the curt reply. The bombardier didn’t see it as a personal attack. The pilot was too busy dodging the vast array of FlaK in the British city. Bright lights in the city were the only thing the bombardier could see. Flashes from FlaK and from bombs exploding turned the city into a destructive Christmas tree. The smoldering wrecks of buildings and of crashed planes the only signs of the thousands lying dead in the streets of London. He reluctantly pressed the button that dropped the last set of bombs onto the already destroyed city. The bomb bay door creaked as it closed, stopping the whipping wind through the fuselage. The bombardier sat on the floor of the aircraft and said a quick prayer to God asking him to forgive the sins he had just committed.

White Two pulled up to coast above the level of the bomber’s wings he was next to. He drifted right across the body of the bomber, dropping down to continue below the right wing. He heard the tell-tale sound of a Spitfire rattling off rounds and pulled the lever to the right and then forward to turn around quickly. He saw the determined face of the British RAF pilot through the canopy and over his breathing mask. With a single hand, the Brit pulled down the goggles on his flight hat, making the pilot lose all semblance of humanity. He appeared to simply be a machine, a thing, not human. He wasn’t a fellow man or a man who just wanted to return home. He was a minister of death, a tool of war. White Two pressed the fire button on the yoke with the Spitfire in the glowing crosshairs. His first volley struck true. Puffs of smoke leapt from the wings of the intrepid Spitfire as bared its teeth to the sky, turning to rise above White Two.

“Hotel Delta Niner reporting in.”
“Go ahead, Hotel Delta,” the tower replied.
“I’ve been scuffed up by a Kraut, but I’m in a position to take out the bombers. Over.”
“Roger, Charlie Bravo, we got you Lima Charlie. Take down a BF-109 for me, over.”
“Understood. Can do. Hotel Delta Niner, over and out.”

Hotel Delta Niner sighed, pulling the mask off his face. He closed his eyes for a long moment, then snapped them open, irises glowing with thoughts of retribution not only for the bullet holes in his metal skin, but also for the explosives loosed too carelessly over the lands he calls home. Rage, rage! coursing through his veins as he hunted the German down, sniffing the grass for the faint scent and firing at any iron cross he saw. Then, all of a sudden, the black figure of a bomber blotted out the moon. Hotel Delta pulled back on his spade yoke with glee, ready to fill this malevolent figure with as much lead as he could pour into the canvas frame.

Throwing the thrusters into max, the engine roared as it forced itself through the air and towards the lazily flying bomber opening its bay doors to drop ordinance on the sleepy countryside south of London. Hotel Delta Niner licked his lips as he joyously placed his thumb over the FIRE button. The fuselage bounced as the forward facing machine guns under the wings roared to life, peppering the back half of the enemy plane with windy holes. The panicked crew hurriedly closed the bomb bay doors to avoid getting blown into the stratosphere by the whims of a bouncing bullet. Hotel Delta smirked, a cackle bubbling up from his chest and forcing its way out of his lips. He quickly neared the bomber, his guns never silencing in their rush to fell the enemy. White hot bullets tore out of the barrels, striking the joint just behind the flaps on the left wing holding the JU88 aloft. The holes popping up on the wing grew into lines, reaching all the way to the opposite side. Noticing this, the pilots on the JU88 threw their yokes to the right, but to their horror, the wing cracked and fell off. The bomber dropped sharply, spinning on a flat plane as it careened to earth; without a single parachute blooming over the collapsing corpse.
