<h1>Sol-Luna</h1>

Obtestate me, demands the sun
Bathe in my light, orders the moon
But which is better?
Which would give me the warmth I seek?

Neither, as I've discovered
In both, do I spectate my shortcomings?
In both, do I plant flags in untrodden soil?
Neither, as I've come to find

Both are at their dusk
Both are at their dawn
Both are at their zenith
Both are at their hiding places

Birds circling overhead
Breezes that bend their forms
Grounds below that wish for their weights
Waters that seek their plunging beaks

Curling tendrils of flame that lap arbor
Black and grey powder that flutters away
Green wood on this fire?
That would put it out.

But when the reserves of kindling dwindle
What else is left but that?
What else could get the fire moving?
What else, but that which hasn't had time to dry?

Black, acrid smoke that chokes out life
The only release
Black, acrid smoke that hides the camp
The only defense

The sun doth rises
The moon doth sets
Then goeth I, to the horizon
Then goeth I, to the spot
That neither walk to
